# Ternary Logic Governance Structure

## I. CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

The Ternary Logic (TL) governance model implements a tripartite structure designed to ensure technical integrity, ethical oversight, and economic sustainability. This governance framework operates under strict constitutional limitations: no governance body, individually or collectively, possesses authority to cease, suspend, or fundamentally alter the TL framework's core principles.

### Fundamental Constraints

1. **Inviolability Principle**: No human authority within the governance structure may terminate TL operations
2. **Separation of Powers**: Each body operates within defined jurisdictional boundaries
3. **Immutable Core**: The Eight Pillars and three-state logic remain unalterable
4. **No Off-Switch**: Unanimous consent cannot override constitutional protections

## II. THE TECHNICAL COUNCIL

### Composition

The Technical Council consists of qualified technologists meeting the following criteria:

- Doctoral degree or equivalent expertise in computer science, cryptography, or financial engineering
- Minimum 10 years experience in distributed systems or financial infrastructure
- Published research in peer-reviewed journals relevant to TL domain
- No concurrent employment with organizations having conflicts of interest

### Jurisdiction

The Technical Council maintains exclusive authority over:

1. **Protocol Standards**
   - Core technical specifications and documentation
   - Cryptographic algorithm selection and updates
   - Performance optimization parameters
   - Interoperability standards

2. **Technical Evolution**
   - Protocol improvement proposals (PIPs)
   - Security vulnerability patches
   - Scalability enhancements
   - API versioning

3. **Security Auditing**
   - Commissioning third-party security assessments
   - Publishing vulnerability disclosure reports
   - Maintaining security best practices documentation

### Limitations

The Technical Council explicitly lacks authority to:

- Modify the three-state logic structure (+1/0/-1)
- Alter the Eight Pillars architecture
- Suspend Epistemic Hold functionality
- Grant exemptions from logging requirements
- Override Stewardship Custodian ethical determinations

### Decision Process

- Quorum: 60% of council members
- Standard decisions: Simple majority
- Protocol changes: 67% supermajority
- Emergency patches: 40% with subsequent ratification

## III. STEWARDSHIP CUSTODIANS

### Composition

Stewardship Custodians represent diverse stakeholder perspectives:

- One representative from academic economics
- One representative from regulatory compliance
- One representative from institutional finance
- One representative from technology ethics
- One representative from international law
- Two at-large positions elected by certified operators

### Jurisdiction

Stewardship Custodians maintain authority over:

1. **Principle Enforcement**
   - Interpreting Goukassian Principle applications
   - Adjudicating violation claims
   - Maintaining ethical guidelines documentation

2. **Operator Certification**
   - Establishing certification requirements
   - Reviewing certification applications
   - Maintaining operator registry

3. **Dispute Resolution**
   - Final arbitration for unresolved disputes
   - Interpretation of ambiguous policy matters
   - Appeal hearings for revocation decisions

### Revocation Authority

Custodians may revoke operator certification for:

- Violation of No Spy prohibition
- Violation of No Weapon prohibition
- Systematic logging failures
- Manipulation of Epistemic Hold thresholds
- Material misrepresentation in certification

### Limitations

Stewardship Custodians explicitly lack authority to:

- Modify technical protocol specifications
- Override Technical Council security determinations
- Suspend framework operations
- Grant blanket exemptions from core principles
- Access operator proprietary data without cause

### Decision Process

- Quorum: 70% of custodians
- Certification decisions: Simple majority
- Revocation decisions: 60% majority
- Principle interpretations: 67% supermajority
- Emergency suspensions: Any two custodians (72-hour duration)

## IV. SMART CONTRACT TREASURY

### Architecture

The Smart Contract Treasury operates as an autonomous, deterministic system:

1. **Revenue Collection**
   - Network transaction fees (0.01% of transaction value)
   - Certification fees (annual operator assessments)
   - Violation penalties (enforced through smart contracts)
   - Voluntary contributions (tax-deductible donations)

2. **Disbursement Rules**
   - Technical development: 40% allocation
   - Security auditing: 20% allocation
   - Governance operations: 15% allocation
   - Research grants: 15% allocation
   - Emergency reserve: 10% allocation

### Funding Triggers

Automated disbursements occur upon:

- Technical Council approved development proposals
- Scheduled security audit contracts
- Quarterly governance operation allocations
- Research grant approval by joint committee
- Emergency authorization (requires both Council and Custodian approval)

### Transparency Requirements

All Treasury operations are:

- Recorded on public blockchain
- Subject to quarterly public reporting
- Auditable by any stakeholder
- Protected against single-point manipulation

### Constitutional Safeguards

The Treasury smart contract includes immutable provisions:

- Cannot fund activities violating core principles
- Cannot be modified without 90-day public notice
- Cannot exceed defined allocation percentages
- Cannot be drained beyond emergency reserve threshold
- Cannot fund framework termination activities

## V. INTER-BODY PROCEDURES

### Change Management Workflow

1. **Proposal Initiation**
   - Technical proposals: Technical Council
   - Policy proposals: Stewardship Custodians
   - Funding proposals: Either body

2. **Review Process**
   - Technical review: 30-day minimum
   - Ethical review: 45-day minimum
   - Public comment: 21-day minimum

3. **Ratification Requirements**
   - Technical changes: Council approval + Custodian non-objection
   - Policy changes: Custodian approval + Council feasibility confirmation
   - Funding changes: Both bodies approval

4. **Implementation**
   - 90-day notice for major changes
   - 30-day notice for minor updates
   - Immediate deployment for security patches

### Dispute Resolution Hierarchy

1. Operator-level resolution attempt
2. Technical Council mediation (technical disputes)
3. Stewardship Custodian arbitration (policy disputes)
4. Joint committee final determination
5. No external appeal beyond governance structure

### Emergency Procedures

Emergency actions permitted only for:

- Active security exploits
- Imminent system failure
- Regulatory compliance orders
- Protection of user funds

Emergency authorities:

- Technical: 40% of Council may deploy patches
- Ethical: Two Custodians may suspend operators
- Financial: Automated circuit breakers in Treasury
- Duration: Maximum 72 hours without full ratification

## VI. ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS

### Public Reporting

- Technical Council: Protocol changes, security assessments
- Stewardship Custodians: Certifications, revocations, disputes
- Smart Contract Treasury: Revenue, disbursements, reserves

### Audit Requirements

Annual independent audits of:

- Technical infrastructure security
- Governance process compliance
- Treasury smart contract integrity
- Operator certification accuracy

### Term Limits and Rotation

- Technical Council: 4-year terms, maximum two consecutive
- Stewardship Custodians: 3-year terms, maximum two consecutive
- Staggered rotation to ensure continuity
- Mandatory 1-year cooling period before reappointment

### Recall Provisions

Members may be removed for:
