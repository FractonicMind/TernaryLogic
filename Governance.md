# Ternary Logic Governance Framework

## Constitutional Foundation

Ternary Logic (TL) is a permanent evidentiary infrastructure for economic decision-making. Governance exists to maintain integrity, enforce foundational mandates, and ensure no single actor or institution can compromise the system. 

**Non-Extinguishability Clause**: TL cannot be terminated, suspended, privatized, or subordinated. This applies to all councils, contracts, jurisdictions, and participants. There is no lawful mechanism to delete or disable TL. Attempts to alter this clause are invalid and must be anchored as violations.

   - Revoke credentials for confirmed violations

### Authority on Violations
Automatic revocation for:
- No Spy prohibition violation
- No Weapon prohibition violation
- Immutable Ledger tampering
- Anchoring interference
- Systematic logging failures

### Emergency Suspension
- Temporary suspension allowed for clear and immediate violations
- Auto-expiry if not confirmed by supermajority within 24 hours
- Automatic reinstatement if quorum not met

### Limitations
- Cannot dissolve or suspend TL
- Cannot modify core pillars or triadic logic

## III. SMART CONTRACT TREASURY

### Purpose
Provide transparent, automatic, and accountable funding for TL infrastructure and development.

### Architecture
Autonomous smart contract system with immutable core rules:

1. **Revenue Collection**
   - Certification fees from operators
   - Network transaction fees (parameter-band model)
   - Violation penalties
   - Research grants and donations

2. **Disbursement Allocation**
   - Technical development: 40%
   - Security auditing: 20%
   - Governance operations: 15%
   - Research grants: 15%
   - Emergency reserve: 10%

### Funding Triggers
Disbursements occur only upon:
1. Technical Council proposal
2. Stewardship Custodian ratification
3. Verified deployment or audit completion

### Safeguards
- Treasury changes require dual supermajority (Council + Custodians)
- 90-day public notice before parameter updates
- Cannot fund activities violating core principles
- Cannot fund framework termination
- All movements auditable, anchored, and transparent

### Shutdown Authority
The Smart Contract Treasury contains the only mechanism capable of system shutdown, triggered exclusively under these conditions:

1. **Gross Violation of Goukassian Principle**
   - Verified autonomous weaponry deployment
   - Confirmed pervasive surveillance implementation
   - Requires cryptographic evidence from independent audit
   - Dual supermajority confirmation from both governance bodies

2. **Systemic Integrity Breach**
   - Evidence of widespread Immutable Ledger tampering
   - Coordinated attack on Anchoring infrastructure
   - Requires forensic verification by three independent auditors

3. **Certificate Revocation Protocol**
   - System fails periodic cryptographic heartbeat check
   - Refusal to comply with mandatory audit
   - Internal logic altered to bypass Epistemic Hold

Shutdown mechanism operates via certificate revocation on public ledger, causing:
- Internal halt of high-risk operations
- External isolation from compliant systems
- Permanent anchoring of violation evidence

## IV. GOVERNANCE INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS

### Decision Logs & Anchoring
Every governance action must:
- Produce a Decision Log with full rationale
- Carry cryptographic signatures of voting members
- Anchor to public blockchain within 24 hours
- Remain permanently auditable

**No log = no action** applies to all governance decisions.

### Conflict of Interest
- Full disclosure required before appointment
- Mandatory recusal when conflicted
- Recusals logged and anchored
- Violation triggers automatic removal

### Appeals Process
1. Internal appeals permitted with new evidence only
2. Technical disputes: Technical Council review
3. Policy disputes: Stewardship Custodian review
4. External review limited to evidence integrity verification
5. External bodies cannot override TL mandates

### Emergency Powers
- Minimal scope and reversible actions only
- Auto-expiration after 72 hours unless ratified
- Logged and anchored at creation and resolution
- Cannot suspend core operations or principles

---

## V. CERTIFICATION & REVOCATION

### Certification Process
1. Application review by Stewardship Custodians
2. Technical compliance verification by Council
3. Independent audit of implementation
4. Public registry entry upon approval
5. Annual compliance attestation required

### Revocation Triggers
Immediate revocation for:
- No Spy violation
- No Weapon violation
- Immutable Ledger tampering
- Anchoring interference
- Epistemic Hold bypass
- Refusal of mandatory audit

### Revocation Process
1. Evidence collection and verification
2. Notice to operator with evidence disclosure
3. 30-day response period (except emergencies)
4. Stewardship Custodian ruling
5. Anchoring of complete proceedings
6. Certificate marked invalid on public ledger
