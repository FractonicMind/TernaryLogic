Notarized_Manifest.txt

This manifest lists all TL documents requiring notarization, anchoring,  
and inclusion in the permanent evidence chain of the Ternary Logic framework.

These files represent the constitutional backbone of TL.  
Each must be notarized, timestamped, and anchored across multiple public chains  
(Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon) using OpenTimestamps or equivalent proofs.

No document on this list may be removed, altered, or superseded without
a recorded, hashed, and publicly anchored event in the permanent TL audit trail.
