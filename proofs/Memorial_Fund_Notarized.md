## The Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund

### **Executive Summary**

The Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund (hereafter "the Fund") is a constitutional financial mechanism established to ensure the perpetual, incorruptible, and autonomous operation of the Ternary Logic (TL) protocol. Its sole mandate is the financial enforcement of the **No Switch Off** principle.

The Fund is not a discretionary treasury, a grant-maker, or an investment vehicle. It is a non-speculative, restricted-use endowment, architected to guarantee the long-term survivability of TL's core governance and anchoring infrastructure, independent of any founder or external organization.

Its operations are governed by the tri-cameral governance model (Technical Council, Stewardship Custodians) and executed by the Smart Contract Treasury. All Fund actions are immutably recorded in the **Decision Logs** and secured by the **Immutable Ledger** and **Anchors**, providing permanent, verifiable auditability.

### **1\. Constitutional Purpose and Scope**

#### **1.1. Core Mandate**

The Fund exists for the exclusive purpose of financing the operational continuity of the Ternary Logic protocol. It ensures that the core governance, succession, and integrity-verification mechanisms of TL remain funded and active for decades, thereby securing the system against abandonment, capture, or infrastructural decay.

#### **1.2. Constitutional Limitations**

The Fund is subordinate to the **Eight Pillars** of Ternary Logic. It possesses no authority to influence, alter, or provide funding for any action that would contravene the Pillars or the core mandates (No Spy, No Weapon, No Switch Off). It is infrastructure, not a political body.

#### **1.3. Non-Speculative, Non-Philanthropic Charter**

The Fund is explicitly and constitutionally prohibited from all forms of speculation, investment, or discretionary grant-making. Its function is to *disburse* for operational necessities, not to *invest* for gain.

* **No Research Grants:** The Fund shall not finance academic research, university programs, or fellowships.  
* **No Speculation:** The Fund shall not engage in lending, trading, or any other financial activity.  
* **No Influence:** The Fund shall not be used for advocacy, stakeholder payouts, or institutional influence-purchasing.

### **2\. Financial and Governance Architecture**

The Fund's architecture is designed for long-horizon stability, resilience against governance failure, and absolute resistance to capture.

#### **2.1. Funding Streams**

The Fund's capital is derived *only* from pre-defined, non-speculative sources:

1. **License Revenue:** Fees generated from the formal licensing of the TL protocol.  
2. **Institutional Contributions:** Formal, unencumbered contributions designated for the perpetual endowment.  
3. **Anchoring Subsidies:** Protocol-native revenue generated from anchoring and notarization services.

#### **2.2. The Smart Contract Treasury: A Dual-Vault Structure**

To ensure perpetuity, the **Smart Contract Treasury** (the autonomous execution layer of governance) is internally segregated into two constitutionally distinct vaults:

1. **The Principal Vault (Endowment):**  
   * **Purpose:** To hold the core long-term endowment of the Fund.  
   * **Rule:** The capital within this vault is constitutionally non-expendable. It serves as the permanent financial guarantor of the No Switch Off mandate.  
2. **The Operational Vault (Disbursement):**  
   * **Purpose:** To hold the liquid capital used for all permitted expenditures.  
   * **Funding:** This vault is funded *only* by the approved, incoming revenue streams (see 2.1).  
   * **Rule:** All expenditures defined in Article 3 are drawn *exclusively* from this vault. This separation ensures that core operational activities never deplete the long-term principal.

### **3\. Jurisprudence of Expenditures**

The Fund operates on a "Permitted Use" model. Any expenditure not explicitly defined in Section 3.1 is constitutionally prohibited.

#### **3.1. Table: Permitted vs. Prohibited Uses**

| PERMITTED USES (Exhaustive List) | PROHIBITED USES (Absolute List) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Anchoring & Integrity:** Multi-chain anchoring fees, OTS/notarization costs, and cross-chain integrity checks. | **1\. Speculation:** All forms of investment, trading, lending, or any other speculative activity. |
| **2\. Audits:** Mandatory, independent cryptographic audits of core smart contracts and governance infrastructure. | **2\. Grants & Philanthropy:** All research grants, fellowships, university funding, and economic initiatives. |
| **3\. Governance Operations:** Non-discretionary operational costs for the Technical Council and Stewardship Custodians. | **3\. Discretionary Spending:** All stakeholder payouts, bonuses, institutional influence-purchasing, or advocacy. |
| **4\. Succession & Continuity:** Costs for Succession Charter enforcement, DMS (Dead-Man's Switch) infrastructure, and vetting/onboarding new Council/Custodian members. | **4\. Capital Violation:** Any disbursement drawn from the Principal Vault (Endowment). |
| **5\. Data & Archives:** Encrypted storage costs for immutable archives (Decision Logs, Epistemic Hold data). | **5\. Pillar Violation:** Any funding for activities that contravene the Eight Pillars or the Three Mandates. |
| **6\. Constitutional Defense:** Pre-approved legal defense funds *only* for protecting the core constitutional principles of TL (e.g., No Switch Off). | **6\. Tokenization:** Any use of funds to create, support, or manage a new token. |
| **7\. Transparency:** Costs for mandatory public transparency reporting on Fund status and expenditures. |  |
| **8\. Key Management:** Costs associated with secure key rotation procedures for governance roles. |  |

### **4\. Governance Alignment and Disbursement Workflow**

The Fund's disbursement mechanism is a direct expression of the tri-cameral governance model, enforcing a strict separation of powers.

1. **Proposal (The Technical Council):** The 9-member **Technical Council** is responsible for identifying operational needs. It drafts a "Funding Proposal" (e.g., "Quarterly Anchoring Fees," "Annual Audit") that specifies the purpose, amount, and recipient. This proposal is submitted as a transaction and recorded in the **Decision Logs**.  
2. **Review & Veto (The Stewardship Custodians):** The 11-member **Stewardship Custodians**—the system's ethical and anti-capture guardians—review the proposal. Their mandate is to verify that the proposal (a) strictly adheres to the **Permitted Uses** list (Article 3\) and (b) does not violate any core TL Pillar (e.g., No Capture). They vote to approve or veto. Their votes are recorded in the **Decision Logs**.  
3. **Execution (The Smart Contract Treasury):** Upon a successful "approve" vote from the Custodians, the **Smart Contract Treasury** (the autonomous machine) *autonomously executes* the disbursement from the Operational Vault. The Treasury contract itself contains the logic of the Permitted/Prohibited Use list as a final, non-human guardrail.

This workflow makes capture impossible:

* The Council (technical) cannot spend without Custodian (ethical) approval.  
* The Custodians (ethical) cannot *initiate* funding proposals, preventing self-dealing.  
* The Treasury (machine) cannot be forced to execute a "Prohibited Use" transaction, even if all human governors approve it.

### **5\. Evidence, Auditing, and Anti-Capture**

#### **5.1. Tamper-Proof Accounting**

The Fund's accounting system *is* the Ternary Logic protocol.

* **Decision Logs:** Every proposal, vote, veto, and disbursement is a unique, immutable entry in the Decision Logs. This creates a permanent, publicly verifiable audit trail from request to execution.  
* **Immutable Ledger & Anchors:** The final, executed transaction is recorded on the Immutable Ledger. The state of the Fund (its balances and logs) is then perpetually notarized across multiple chains via Anchors, making a fraudulent or unrecorded transaction impossible.

#### **5.2. Data Privacy (GDPR/ERK Compliance)**

While all *actions* are transparent, associated sensitive data (e.g., legal invoices, auditor identification) is handled by the **Epistemic Hold**.

* The *proof* of payment is public (e.g., "Disbursement 77A, 500 units, for 'Constitutional Defense'").  
* The *private data* (the invoice itself) is encrypted and stored in the Epistemic Hold, accessible *only* to the Stewardship Custodians for audit, thus respecting privacy and legal obligations (GDPR/ERK) without sacrificing accountability.

#### **5.3. Anti-Capture Safeguards**

The Fund is protected from capture by its architecture:

1. **Structural:** The separation of the Principal (non-expendable) and Operational (expendable) vaults prevents a "bank run" or looting of the core endowment.  
2. **Governance:** The separation of powers (propose/review/execute) prevents any single governance body from controlling the Fund.  
3. **Constitutional:** The absolute, smart-contract-enforced "Prohibited Uses" list (Article 3\) ensures funds cannot be diverted for speculation, bribery, or grant-making, even by a majority vote.

### **6\. Long-Horizon Continuity (No Switch Off)**

The Fund is designed to outlive its creators and all subsequent governance members.

#### **6.1. Autonomous Core Services**

To defeat governance failure or abandonment, the Smart Contract Treasury is constitutionally *pre-authorized* to autonomously pay for essential, non-discretionary services defined as critical to the No Switch Off mandate. This includes:

* Multi-chain anchoring fees.  
* Immutable archive storage costs.  
* DMS infrastructure costs for the Succession Charter.

These core services are funded automatically from the Operational Vault (within pre-set budgetary limits), requiring *no new governance vote*. A vote is only required to *change* these budgetary limits or to approve *new* expenditures. This ensures the protocol's heart (anchoring) and its immune system (succession) keep running even if the human governance layer stalls.

#### **6.2. Succession Protocol Enforcement**

The Fund is the guarantor of the **Succession Charter**. If governance members become incapacitated or abandon their roles (triggering the DMS), the Fund automatically provides the capital required for the succession workflow. It pays for the vetting and onboarding of new Council and Custodian members, ensuring the human governance layer can be perpetually and autonomously reconstituted.

The Fund, therefore, does not just *support* the protocol; it is the autonomous financial engine that *enforces* its immortality.
