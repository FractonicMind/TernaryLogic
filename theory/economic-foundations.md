##  Theoretical Overview

The Ternary Logic (TL) framework represents a fundamental advancement in economic decision-making theory, extending traditional binary choice models with intelligent uncertainty management. This document establishes the comprehensive economic theoretical foundation supporting the framework's applications across financial markets, monetary policy, and business operations.

### Core Economic Innovation

**Traditional Economic Models**: Force complex decisions into binary choices (buy/sell, expand/contract, invest/divest)

**Ternary Logic Framework**: Introduces the **Epistemic Hold** - a third state acknowledging when economic complexity exceeds immediate decision-making capacity

**Revolutionary Insight**: Economic intelligence emerges not from faster decisions, but from knowing when to pause for deliberation

---

##  Mathematical Framework

### Ternary Decision Function

The TL framework operates on a three-state decision space:

```
TL(s, c, r) = {
    +1  if  confidence(s) > θ_c  AND  risk(s) < θ_r
    -1  if  risk(s) > θ_h     OR  systematic_risk(s) = TRUE  
     0  otherwise (Epistemic Hold)
}

Where:
s = economic scenario
c = confidence threshold  
r = risk threshold
θ_c = confidence threshold for proceeding
θ_r = risk tolerance threshold
θ_h = halt threshold for high risk
```

### Uncertainty Quantification

The framework quantifies economic uncertainty across multiple dimensions:

**Market Uncertainty (U_m)**:
- Volatility measures (historical and implied)
- Liquidity conditions and market depth
- Information asymmetry indicators

**Systematic Uncertainty (U_s)**:
- Macroeconomic policy shifts
- Geopolitical risk factors
- Structural market changes

**Temporal Uncertainty (U_t)**:
- Time-dependent factors
- Event risk (earnings, policy announcements)
- Market regime transitions

**Combined Uncertainty Score**:
```
U_total = α·U_m + β·U_s + γ·U_t

Where α + β + γ = 1 and weights are domain-calibrated
```
