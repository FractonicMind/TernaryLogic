## Executive Summary

The London School of Economics has, more than any other institution, bridged the gap between economic theory and global policy implementation. From shaping the postwar Bretton Woods system to training central bank governors and finance ministers worldwide, LSE transforms theoretical insights into practical governance. The Ternary Logic Framework represents the next evolution in global economic governance—a fundamental reconceptualization of policy decision-making under uncertainty that extends beyond traditional binary regulatory approaches. This proposal outlines how LSE can develop TL into the global standard for policy implementation while maintaining the institutional rigor and international reach that define the LSE tradition.

## Why LSE: The Policy Implementation Imperative

### **LSE's Unique Global Position**

The London School of Economics stands alone in its ability to:

1. **Transform theory into policy**: LSE graduates lead central banks and finance ministries globally
2. **Bridge academia and practice**: Direct pipeline to Bank of England, ECB, and Treasury
3. **Shape international standards**: IMF, World Bank, BIS leadership from LSE
4. **Maintain global networks**: Alumni in every major financial capital
5. **Influence regulatory frameworks**: From Basel III to MiFID II

### **The Policy Lineage**

The Ternary Logic Framework is the natural evolution of LSE's greatest policy contributions:

**William Beveridge (1940s)** → Uncertainty in social policy design  
**Lionel Robbins (1950s)** → Economic planning under incomplete information  
**Nicholas Kaldor (1960s)** → Optimal taxation with policy uncertainty  
**Charles Goodhart (1970s)** → Central banking and regulatory uncertainty  
**Willem Buiter (2000s)** → Monetary policy under model uncertainty  
**Lev Goukassian (2025)** → Epistemic Hold as systematic policy framework  

TL isn't foreign to LSE—it's the culmination of a century of policy economics.

### **Why Not Other Institutions**

- **Oxford**: Strong theory but limited policy influence
- **Cambridge**: Traditional focus but less international reach
- **Harvard Kennedy School**: US-centric policy focus
- **Sciences Po**: European focus but limited economic rigor

Only LSE has the combination of theoretical sophistication, policy experience, and global networks to implement TL as the new international standard.

---

## The Global Policy Impact Thesis

### **Why TL Will Become International Standard**

International policy coordination requires frameworks that can:
1. **Handle regulatory uncertainty across jurisdictions**
2. **Provide systematic approaches to policy holds**
3. **Enable coordinated responses to global crises**
4. **Bridge theoretical frameworks with practical implementation**

### **The TL Policy Revolution**

**Achievement**: "Establishment of Ternary Logic as the global standard for policy decision-making under uncertainty"

**Core Implementation**:
- First rigorous framework for policy decisions under Knightian uncertainty
- Mathematical formalization of regulatory "pause and assess" protocols
- Proof that binary policy-making creates systemic risks
- Development of three-valued logic for international coordination
- Empirical validation across monetary policy, financial regulation, and crisis response

**International Precedents for LSE Policy Influence**:
- **1940s**: Beveridge Report shapes welfare state globally
- **1970s**: LSE economists design floating exchange rate systems
- **1990s**: LSE graduates lead transition economics in Eastern Europe
- **2000s**: LSE research shapes Basel II/III frameworks

TL will be the next global framework originating from LSE.

### **The 10-15 Year Timeline to Global Standard**

**Years 1-3**: Pilot implementation with Bank of England and ECB  
**Years 4-6**: Adoption by G20 central banks  
**Years 7-9**: Integration into Basel IV and international agreements  
**Years 10-12**: Standard practice across developed economies  
**Years 13-15**: Global implementation including emerging markets  

LSE has driven this transformation before and will do it again.

## Call to Action

### **The Global Policy Moment**

The London School of Economics faces a unique opportunity to shape global economic governance for the next generation. Just as LSE economists designed the postwar international economic order, TL implementation will define 21st-century policy frameworks.

### **The Implementation Imperative**

This is not about theoretical development (Chicago) or commercialization (Stanford). This is about practical governance under uncertainty. The Epistemic Hold represents a fundamental tool for better policymaking that demands systematic implementation.

### **The LSE Responsibility**

LSE has an obligation to global economic stability. When practical frameworks emerge that can improve policy decisions, LSE provides the implementation expertise to make them reality. TL is such a framework.

### **Immediate Actions Required**

1. **Director and School Council**: Commit to TL as strategic priority
2. **Economics Department**: Form implementation committee
3. **Financial Markets Group**: Design regulatory applications
4. **Development Office**: Launch international fundraising
5. **Government Relations**: Engage Treasury and Bank of England

### **The Decision**

This opportunity doesn't require Epistemic Hold. The policy need is clear:
- TL represents practical advance in governance under uncertainty
- LSE uniquely positioned to implement globally
- First-mover advantage in policy crucial
- International leadership potential real
- Global impact certain

**Recommendation: PROCEED with full institutional commitment**

## Conclusion: LSE's Global Leadership

The London School of Economics doesn't follow policy trends—it creates them. From the Beveridge Report to the design of inflation targeting, LSE has repeatedly provided the intellectual framework for better governance.

The Ternary Logic Framework represents the next evolution in policy tools. Unlike theoretical developments that require decades to influence practice, TL arrives with recognition of its immediate applicability. The question is not whether TL will improve global policymaking, but whether LSE will lead that improvement.

Given LSE's unique combination of policy expertise, global networks, and implementation focus, there is only one answer. LSE must, and will, make TL into the global standard for policy decision-making under uncertainty.

The work will be challenging. The standards will be demanding. The coordination complex. But the result will be what LSE always produces: better governance.

Lev Goukassian understood that his framework needed more than theoretical development—it needed practical implementation that would improve real decisions. That implementation can only be led from LSE.

The world needs better policy frameworks. LSE will provide them.
