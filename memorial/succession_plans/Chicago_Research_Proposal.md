## Why Chicago: The Theoretical Powerhouse

Chicago's unmatched strength in economic theory makes it ideal for establishing TL's **academic foundations**:
- **9 Nobel Laureates** in Economics currently on faculty
- **Chicago School** tradition of rigorous theoretical work
- **Becker Friedman Institute**: Policy applications
- **Booth School**: Empirical finance excellence
