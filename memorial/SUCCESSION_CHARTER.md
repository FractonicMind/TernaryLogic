## Final Words from Lev Goukassian

*"I created the Ternary Logic Framework not as my monument, but as humanity's tool. The Epistemic Holdâthat moment of productive uncertaintyârepresents my deepest belief that wisdom lies not in quick answers but in thoughtful questions.*

*As I face my own ultimate uncertainty, I take comfort knowing this framework will outlive me, helping future generations make wiser economic decisions. Every time a system pauses to consider complexity rather than forcing binary choices, my vision lives on.*

*To those who will shepherd this work after me: Honor the uncertainty. Embrace the complexity. And always remember that behind every economic decision are human lives and dreams.*

*The future is not binary. Make it thoughtful."*

â Lev Goukassian, Creator of Ternary Logic
