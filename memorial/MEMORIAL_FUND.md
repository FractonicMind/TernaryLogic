# The Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund for Economic Decision Research

## I. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

The Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund supports continued research in intelligent economic decision-making under uncertainty through the Ternary Logic (TL) framework. The fund advances theoretical development and practical implementation of the Epistemic Hold principle in financial systems, policy analysis, and economic infrastructure.

### Core Mission

Advance economic decision theory through research, education, and implementation of Ternary Logic principles, focusing on uncertainty management in complex economic systems.
