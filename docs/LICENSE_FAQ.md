## Basic License Questions

### 1. What license is the Ternary Logic Framework under?
**MIT License with Ethical Use Requirements.** You get all the freedoms of MIT (copy, modify, sell) **plus** an extra clause that prohibits unethical financial use.

### 2. Can I use this code in a commercial product?
Yes—sell it, embed it, SaaS-it—**as long as** the end use isn't for market manipulation or systemic harm.

### 3. Do I have to open-source my own product?
No. MIT allows private forks and closed-source derivatives.

### 4. How must I credit the original author?
Include **exactly** this line in source headers, about boxes, or docs:
```
Ternary Logic Framework © Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)
```

### 5. Can I change the license in my fork?
You can **add** any compatible license, but you **cannot** remove the MIT + Ethical Use text.

## Ethical Use Guidelines

### 6. What counts as "Ethical Use"?
Any use that **benefits stakeholders** without deception, manipulation, or disproportionate risk-shifting.

### 7. What counts as "Unethical Use"?
* Spoofing, wash-trading, pump-and-dump schemes
* Predatory lending or insurance denial bots
* Any system designed to **exploit** information asymmetry for harm
* Market manipulation algorithms
* High-frequency trading designed to disadvantage retail investors
* Financial products that intentionally obscure risks

### 8. Who decides if my use is unethical?
A **community ethics board** plus the **succession trustees** named in `memorial/SUCCESSION_CHARTER.md`. Decisions are published transparently.

### 9. How is enforcement carried out?
1. Public registry of revoked licenses
2. GitHub API key revocation for future downloads
3. Social / reputational notice—**no monetary damages**
4. Community notification and warning systems

### 10. How do I request an ethics waiver?
Email **support@tl-goukassian.org** with a 1-page justification. Waivers are rare and published publicly for transparency.

## Commercial and Distribution

### 11. Can I embed Ternary Logic in a mobile app?
Yes—just keep the attribution visible in the app or its About screen.

### 12. Can I redistribute a modified binary?
Yes, as long as you:
* Keep the MIT + Ethical Use text
* Provide source on request (MIT obligation)
* Do not remove the ethical use clause

### 13. Does the clause apply to internal prototypes?
No. Internal R&D is fine; it triggers only when deployed **externally** or affects real financial decisions.

### 14. Can cloud providers host the repo?
Yes—GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket mirrors are all welcome. Hosting providers are not responsible for end-user compliance.

### 15. What about white-label or OEM use?
Permitted under standard MIT terms, but the ethical use requirements follow the technology wherever it's deployed.

## Academic and Research Use

### 16. Can I use Ternary Logic in academic papers?
**Encouraged.** Please cite:
```
Goukassian, L. (2025). Ternary Logic: Implementing Epistemic Hesitation in Economic Systems.
```

### 17. Is there a contributor license agreement (CLA)?
No CLA required—your contributions remain MIT-licensed with the same ethical use requirements.

### 18. Does the license cover the benchmark dataset?
Yes. The **25+ scenario dataset** inherits the same MIT + Ethical Use terms.

### 19. Can I use this in educational software?
**Highly encouraged.** Educational use is considered inherently ethical and beneficial.

## Branding and Identity

### 20. Can I use the logo or branding?
Currently no official logo exists. Framework name "Ternary Logic" is descriptive and can be used with proper attribution.

### 21. Can I create TL-based product names?
Yes, but avoid implying official endorsement. Example: "MyApp (powered by Ternary Logic)" is fine.

---

## Succession and Governance

### 22. What happens if the successor trustee disappears?
The **succession charter** auto-transfers authority to pre-authorized universities (MIT, Stanford, Chicago, LSE) and international organizations (BIS, IMF, World Bank).

### 23. Can the ethical use requirements change?
Only through the governance process outlined in the succession charter, with input from the economics community and memorial trustees.

### 24. What if I find unethical use by others?
Report to **support@tl-goukassian.org** with evidence. The community takes misuse seriously and will investigate promptly.

---

## Technical and Integration

### 25. How do I update to newer versions safely?
Each version maintains the same license terms. Check the CHANGELOG.md for any new ethical guidelines or clarifications.

### 26. Can I strip out the ethical checking code?
The license prohibits removing ethical safeguards, but you can customize thresholds and parameters within ethical bounds.

### 27. What about cryptocurrency or DeFi use?
Permitted for legitimate financial services, but prohibited for pump-and-dump, rug pulls, or other crypto scams.

### 28. Can I use this in government or regulatory systems?
**Encouraged.** Government use for public benefit is considered inherently ethical.

## Memorial and Legacy

### 29. Why the ethical use requirement?
This framework represents Lev Goukassian's final contribution during his battle with cancer. The ethical clause ensures his vision of "thoughtful economics" isn't perverted for harm.

### 30. How does this honor the creator's memory?
Every ethical use advances the vision of economic systems that are **intelligent partners** rather than exploitative tools.
