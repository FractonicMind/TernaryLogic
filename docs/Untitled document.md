### **8\. A Proposed Model for Calculating the Confidence Threshold**

A cornerstone of the mandatory **Epistemic Hold** is the confidence threshold—a quantitative measure that determines whether a decision can proceed or must be paused. The following is a proposed model for calculating this threshold, grounded in principles of decision science and adapted for the nuances of economic systems. This model moves beyond a simplistic static value and incorporates a dynamic, multi-factor approach.

The confidence score (CS​) for a given decision is a function of four primary factors: signal strength, signal consistency, environmental volatility, and the cost of error.

**Equation 1: Confidence Score Calculation**

CS​=SS​×SC​−(EV​+CE​)

* CS​ \= The final confidence score (ranging from 0 to 1). A score above the predefined threshold bypasses the **Epistemic Hold**.  
* SS​ \= **Signal Strength** (0 to 1): A normalized score representing the collective weight of evidence supporting a specific binary outcome (+1 or \-1). For example, a strong, high-volume trading signal would yield a high SS​.  
* SC​ \= **Signal Consistency** (0 to 1): A score representing the degree of alignment among all signals. If technical and fundamental signals are in agreement, SC​ is high. If they are in conflict (e.g., strong buy signal with a conflicting news report), SC​ is low.  
* EV​ \= **Environmental Volatility** (0 to 1): A factor representing the level of market or systemic instability. In a flash crash or a period of high geopolitical tension, EV​ would be high, reducing the confidence score and increasing the likelihood of an **Epistemic Hold**.  
* CE​ \= **Cost of Error** (0 to 1): A normalized value representing the potential economic or systemic cost of a wrong decision. For a high-stakes decision like a central bank policy change or a large-block trade, CE​ would be high, demanding a greater level of certainty to proceed.

The `TernaryLogic` framework would calculate this confidence score for every decision. The **Epistemic Hold** is then mandated if:

CS​≤Threshold

This model ensures that the **Epistemic Hold** is not a static or arbitrary decision but is dynamically triggered by the genuine complexity of the economic environment, the quality of the available data, and the potential consequences of a mistake. This provides a clear, auditable, and rational basis for the system's decision to hesitate, thereby directly supporting the principles of transparency and accountability.
