## Overview of TL States

The Ternary Logic Framework operates with three distinct states:

| State | Value | Trigger Condition | Action |
|-------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| **PROCEED** | +1 | Confidence ≥ 0.85 | Execute transaction |
| **EPISTEMIC_HOLD** | 0 | 0.40 ≤ Confidence < 0.85 | Pause for deliberation |
| **HALT** | -1 | Confidence < 0.40 | Reject transaction |

**Target Epistemic Hold Rate:** 15-25% of all decisions (optimal balance between speed and prudence)

---

## The Eight Architectural Pillars

### 1. Epistemic Hold - Pre-Settlement Verification

**Purpose:** Codifies uncertainty as an active, intelligent pause before execution.

**Mechanism:**
- Triggered when uncertainty or complexity exceeds predefined thresholds
- Analyzes economic confidence, signal conflicts, information completeness
- Creates mandatory, auditable pause for deliberation

**Integration with Thresholds:**
- When confidence score falls into [0.40, 0.85) range
- When mandatory verification checks fail (Economic Rights, Sustainable Capital)
- When model conflict exceeds 30% disagreement
- When data is missing, stale (>24 hours), or unverifiable

### 2. Immutable Ledger - Settlement Finality

**Purpose:** Creates tamper-evident, chronologically sound record of all transactions.

**Mechanism:**
- Distributed ledger technology (DLT) with cryptographic hashing
- Each block contains hash of previous block (blockchain structure)
- Single source of truth for all network participants

**Integration with Thresholds:**
- Records the complete decision process: +1 intent → 0 Hold → final +1 or -1 outcome
- Stores confidence scores and reasoning for all decisions
- Provides cryptographic proof of when thresholds were crossed
- Enables post-hoc analysis for threshold recalibration

### 3. Goukassian Principle - Systemic Health Observability

**Purpose:** Engineers ethical accountability through "moral trace logs" during deliberation.

**Mechanism:**
- Creates "Always Memory Logs" during Sacred Pause (Epistemic Hold)
- Documents reasoning, alternatives considered, risk assessments
- Cryptographically sealed and immutable

**Integration with Thresholds:**
- Activated automatically when Epistemic Hold is triggered
- Documents why threshold was crossed (data quality issue, model conflict, etc.)
- Creates legal evidence for "reverse burden of proof"
- Enables system designers to prove standard of care

### 4. Decision Logs - Accountability & Causal Audit

**Purpose:** Comprehensive audit trails capturing complete context of every material action.

**Mechanism:**
- Records: identities, timestamps, inputs, models, confidence scores, state transitions
- Creates "intellectual history" for every transaction
- Immutably linked to Immutable Ledger

**Integration with Thresholds:**
- Logs which threshold was crossed and why
- Records all input data used in confidence calculation
- Tracks model outputs and disagreements
- Provides data for backtesting and threshold optimization
- **THIS IS HOW TL KNOWS COMPLEXITY HIT:** Decision Logs capture all signals that feed into confidence calculation

### 5. Economic Rights & Transparency - Digital Property Rights (MANDATED)

**Purpose:** Ensures ownership, consent, data provenance, and regulatory access.

**Mechanism (Automatic Trigger):**
```python
Checks Required:
├── Beneficial ownership verified?
├── Consent obtained from all parties?
├── Data provenance cryptographically signed?
└── Regulatory access granted?

IF ANY CHECK FAILS:
    → AUTOMATIC EPISTEMIC_HOLD (confidence = 0.0)
    → Log failure reason in Decision Logs
    → Create Goukassian Principle trace
    → Record on Immutable Ledger
```

**Integration with Thresholds:**
- **Overrides confidence-based thresholds**
- Even if calculated confidence = 0.95, mandate failure triggers hold
- Binary pass/fail (no gradual confidence score)
- Creates audit trail showing which specific check failed

### 6. Sustainable Capital Allocation - Verifiable Impact & ESG (MANDATED)

**Purpose:** Combat greenwashing with verifiable sustainability credentials.

**Mechanism (Automatic Trigger):**
```python
Checks Required:
├── ESG data verified by certified third party?
├── Emissions report cryptographically anchored?
└── Use of proceeds tracked via smart contract?

IF ANY CHECK FAILS:
    → AUTOMATIC EPISTEMIC_HOLD (confidence = 0.0)
    → Log which sustainability claim failed
    → Create verification trace in Goukassian logs
    → Record failure on Immutable Ledger
```

**Integration with Thresholds:**
- **Overrides confidence-based thresholds**
- Mandatory for green bonds, ESG-linked instruments
- Binary verification (pass/fail)
- Prevents execution even with high confidence if ESG unverified

### 7. Hybrid Shield - Confidentiality & Verifiability

**Purpose:** Balance institutional privacy with public transparency.

**Mechanism:**
- Private permissioned layer: confidential transaction details
- Public permissionless layer: cryptographic proofs anchored

**Integration with Thresholds:**
- Threshold decisions recorded on private layer (confidential)
- Cryptographic hash of decision anchored to public layer
- Public can verify integrity without seeing details
- Regulators have permissioned access to full Decision Logs

### 8. Anchors - Decentralized Proof of Integrity

**Purpose:** Ground digital system in real-world governance, interoperability, veracity.

**Types:**
1. **Governance Anchors:** Hybrid on/off-chain governance model
2. **Interoperability Anchors:** Cross-chain bridges, multi-chain support
3. **Veracity Anchors:** Blockchain notarization of real-world evidence

**Integration with Thresholds:**
- Governance Anchors: Who sets/adjusts thresholds (consortium board, technical committee)
- Interoperability Anchors: Threshold decisions portable across systems
- Veracity Anchors: Real-world documents (audit reports, identity) factored into confidence score

---

## Threshold Establishment Methods

### Method 1: Historical Backtesting (Primary)

**Process:**
1. Collect 20+ years of historical decisions and outcomes
2. Test various threshold combinations (0.80/0.35, 0.85/0.40, 0.90/0.45)
3. Simulate decisions using each threshold pair
4. Measure performance metrics:
   - False positives (bad decisions executed)
   - False negatives (good opportunities missed)
   - Total cost = (false_positives × cost_of_error) + (false_negatives × cost_of_delay)
5. Select thresholds that minimize total cost

**Example Results:**
```
Threshold Pair | False Positives | False Negatives | Total Cost
0.80 / 0.35    | 45              | 12              | $125M
0.85 / 0.40    | 28              | 18              | $89M  ← OPTIMAL
0.90 / 0.45    | 15              | 35              | $112M
```

**Who Decides:** Technical Committee (data scientists, risk managers) propose thresholds based on backtesting. Governance Anchor (board/consortium) approves.

### Method 2: Regulatory Requirements (Constraints)

**Mandated Thresholds:**
- **Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio:** Must maintain ≥100% LCR
  - If LCR confidence < 0.85 → EPISTEMIC_HOLD
  - If LCR confidence < 0.40 → HALT (regulatory breach imminent)
  
- **FATF AML/CFT Screening:**
  - Clear: confidence ≥ 0.95 → PROCEED
  - Review: 0.70 ≤ confidence < 0.95 → EPISTEMIC_HOLD
  - Block: confidence < 0.30 → HALT

**Who Decides:** Regulators (BIS, FSB, national central banks) set minimum thresholds. Institutions may use stricter thresholds but not looser.

### Method 3: Institutional Risk Tolerance (Policy)

**Board-Approved Risk Appetite:**
- Conservative institutions: PROCEED ≥ 0.90, HALT < 0.50
- Standard institutions: PROCEED ≥ 0.85, HALT < 0.40 (default)
- Aggressive institutions: PROCEED ≥ 0.80, HALT < 0.35

**Who Decides:** Board of Directors approves risk appetite. CRO (Chief Risk Officer) translates into thresholds. Technical Committee implements.

### Method 4: Market Regime Adaptation (Dynamic)

**Volatility-Based Adjustment:**
```python
VIX < 20 (Normal):
    proceed_threshold = 0.85
    hold_threshold = 0.40

VIX 20-30 (Elevated):
    proceed_threshold = 0.90  # More cautious
    hold_threshold = 0.50

VIX > 30 (Crisis):
    proceed_threshold = 0.95  # Very high bar
    hold_threshold = 0.60     # Hold on almost everything
```

**Who Decides:** Automated adjustment based on pre-approved volatility bands. Technical Committee defines bands. Governance Anchor approves activation rules.

### Method 5: Mandate Verification (Binary)

**Automatic Triggers:**
- Economic Rights & Transparency: ANY verification failure → EPISTEMIC_HOLD
- Sustainable Capital Allocation: ANY ESG verification failure → EPISTEMIC_HOLD

**Who Decides:** Framework mandate (non-negotiable). Defined in protocol specification. Cannot be overridden by individual institutions.

## Composite Confidence Calculation

**How TL Knows Complexity Hit:**

The confidence score is calculated from four equally-weighted factors (25% each):

### 1. Data Quality Score (25%)

**Checks:**
- **Completeness:** All required fields present? (Yes = 1.0, Partial = 0.5, No = 0.0)
- **Freshness:** Data age < 24 hours? (Yes = 1.0, 24-48hrs = 0.7, >48hrs = 0.3)
- **Verification:** Cryptographically signed? (Yes = 1.0, No = 0.0)
- **Source Reputation:** Historical reliability of data provider

**Formula:**
```python
data_quality = 0.25 × (completeness + freshness + verification + reputation) / 4
```

**Recorded in Decision Logs:**
- Which fields were missing
- Age of each data source
- Which signatures failed verification
- Provider reliability scores

### 2. Model Agreement Score (25%)

**Checks:**
- **Consensus:** Do multiple models agree? (All agree = 1.0, Split = 0.5, Disagree = 0.0)
- **Variance:** How much do outputs differ? (Low variance = 1.0, High = 0.0)
- **Confidence Distribution:** Are models certain or uncertain?

**Formula:**
```python
mean_output = sum(model_outputs) / num_models
variance = sum((output - mean_output)² for output in outputs) / num_models
model_agreement = max(0.0, 1.0 - variance)
```

**Recorded in Decision Logs:**
- Output from each model
- Variance calculation
- Which models disagreed and by how much
- **IF VARIANCE > 0.30: THIS IS MODEL CONFLICT → EPISTEMIC_HOLD TRIGGER**

### 3. Historical Accuracy Score (25%)

**Checks:**
- **Recent Performance:** Model accuracy over last 90 days
- **Weighted Recency:** More recent predictions weighted higher
- **Regime Stability:** Has market regime changed?

**Formula:**
```python
# Predictions from last 90 days
historical_accuracy = sum(correct_predictions) / total_predictions_90_days

# Apply recency weighting
weighted_accuracy = sum(accuracy[i] × decay_factor^i for i in range(90))
```

**Recorded in Decision Logs:**
- 90-day accuracy history
- Recent prediction outcomes
- Regime change indicators

### 4. Signal Strength Score (25%)

**Checks:**
- **Directional Clarity:** Clear buy/sell/hold signal? (Clear = 1.0, Mixed = 0.5, Unclear = 0.0)
- **Noise Level:** Signal-to-noise ratio (High SNR = 1.0, Low = 0.0)
- **Indicator Alignment:** Do technical indicators agree?

**Formula:**
```python
signal_strength = 0.25 × (directional_clarity + snr + indicator_alignment) / 3
```

**Recorded in Decision Logs:**
- Each indicator value
- Signal-to-noise calculation
- Which indicators conflicted

### Final Confidence Calculation

```python
confidence = (
    0.25 × data_quality +
    0.25 × model_agreement +
    0.25 × historical_accuracy +
    0.25 × signal_strength
)

# Clamp to [0.0, 1.0]
confidence = max(0.0, min(1.0, confidence))
```

**Decision Logs Record:**
- All four component scores
- Final composite confidence
- Timestamp of calculation
- Input data used
- Which component(s) dragged confidence down

**This is how TL knows complexity hit:** When any component score is low, it reduces overall confidence, potentially triggering Epistemic Hold.

---

## Automatic Trigger Mechanisms

### Trigger Type 1: Confidence-Based (Continuous)

**Mechanism:**
```python
if confidence >= 0.85:
    state = PROCEED
elif confidence < 0.40:
    state = HALT
else:
    state = EPISTEMIC_HOLD  # Uncertainty zone
```

**Logged in Decision Logs:**
- Exact confidence score
- Which threshold crossed
- Component breakdown showing why

### Trigger Type 2: Mandate-Based (Binary Override)

**Mechanism:**
```python
# Check Economic Rights
if not all([ownership_verified, consent_obtained, provenance_signed, regulatory_access]):
    state = EPISTEMIC_HOLD  # FORCED
    confidence = 0.0  # Override any calculated confidence
    reason = "Economic Rights mandate failed: {failed_checks}"

# Check Sustainable Capital
if not all([esg_verified, emissions_anchored, use_of_proceeds_tracked]):
    state = EPISTEMIC_HOLD  # FORCED
    confidence = 0.0
    reason = "Sustainable Capital mandate failed: {failed_checks}"
```

**Logged in Decision Logs:**
- Which mandate failed
- Which specific checks failed
- Evidence of verification attempts
- **CRITICAL:** Even if confidence would be 0.95, mandate failure overrides

### Trigger Type 3: Model Conflict (Threshold-Based)

**Mechanism:**
```python
model_outputs = [model1.predict(), model2.predict(), model3.predict()]
mean = sum(model_outputs) / len(model_outputs)
max_deviation = max(abs(output - mean) for output in model_outputs)

if max_deviation > 0.30:  # 30% disagreement threshold
    state = EPISTEMIC_HOLD
    reason = "Significant model disagreement detected"
```

**Logged in Decision Logs:**
- Output from each model
- Deviation calculation
- Which models disagreed most

### Trigger Type 4: Data Staleness (Time-Based)

**Mechanism:**
```python
for data_source in data_sources:
    age_hours = (now - data_source.timestamp).total_seconds() / 3600
    
    if age_hours > 24:
        state = EPISTEMIC_HOLD
        reason = f"Data source {data_source.name} is {age_hours:.1f} hours old"
        break
```

**Logged in Decision Logs:**
- Age of each data source
- Which source triggered staleness alert
- Last successful update timestamp

## Pillar Integration: How They Work Together

### Example Transaction Flow

**Scenario:** Bank wants to approve $10M trade financing for renewable energy project

#### Step 1: Initial Intent (+1)
- Transaction submitted to TL system
- Recorded on **Immutable Ledger** with timestamp
- **Decision Logs** begin recording

#### Step 2: Mandate Verification (Pillar 5 & 6)
```python
# Pillar 5: Economic Rights & Transparency
ownership_check = verify_beneficial_ownership()  # ✓ Pass
consent_check = verify_all_party_consent()       # ✓ Pass
provenance_check = verify_data_provenance()      # ✓ Pass
regulatory_check = verify_regulator_access()     # ✓ Pass

# Pillar 6: Sustainable Capital Allocation
esg_check = verify_esg_data()                    # ✗ FAIL - ESG report not verified
emissions_check = verify_emissions_anchor()      # ✓ Pass
proceeds_check = verify_smart_contract_track()   # ✓ Pass

# RESULT: Sustainable Capital mandate FAILED
→ AUTOMATIC EPISTEMIC_HOLD (Pillar 1)
→ confidence = 0.0 (forced)
```

**What Happens:**
- **Pillar 1 (Epistemic Hold):** Activated automatically
- **Pillar 3 (Goukassian Principle):** Creates "Always Memory Log" documenting:
  - Intent: Approve $10M trade financing
  - Deliberation: ESG verification failed - third-party audit missing
  - Options considered: Wait for audit, request additional verification, reject
  - Risk assessment: Proceeding without ESG verification violates mandate
- **Pillar 4 (Decision Logs):** Records complete audit trail:
  - All verification checks and results
  - ESG report status: unverified
  - Time spent in Hold: 4 hours
- **Pillar 2 (Immutable Ledger):** Writes: +1 intent → 0 Hold (ESG failure) → pending resolution
- **Pillar 7 (Hybrid Shield):** 
  - Private layer: Full details (client names, amounts)
  - Public layer: Hash proving Hold occurred at timestamp
- **Pillar 8 (Anchors):**
  - Veracity Anchor: ESG report hash attempted, verification failed
  - Interoperability Anchor: Hold status shared with linked systems

#### Step 3: Resolution Process

**Bank obtains verified ESG audit (4 hours later):**

```python
# Re-check Sustainable Capital mandate
esg_check = verify_esg_data()  # ✓ Pass (now verified)

# All mandates now pass
# Calculate composite confidence
data_quality = 0.90  # Complete, fresh, verified
model_agreement = 0.88  # Models agree on creditworthiness
historical_accuracy = 0.85  # Recent accuracy good
signal_strength = 0.92  # Clear positive signals

confidence = 0.25 × (0.90 + 0.88 + 0.85 + 0.92) = 0.89

# confidence = 0.89 ≥ 0.85 → PROCEED
```

**What Happens:**
- **Pillar 1 (Epistemic Hold):** Resolved with PROCEED state
- **Pillar 3 (Goukassian Principle):** Updates Always Memory Log:
  - Resolution: ESG audit obtained and verified
  - Final decision: PROCEED with transaction
  - Justification: All mandates now satisfied, confidence = 0.89
- **Pillar 4 (Decision Logs):** Records complete resolution:
  - Hold duration: 4 hours
  - Resolution action: ESG audit verification
  - Final confidence: 0.89
  - Final state: PROCEED
- **Pillar 2 (Immutable Ledger):** Writes final entry: 0 Hold → +1 PROCEED
- **Pillar 7 (Hybrid Shield):** Updates both layers with resolution
- **Pillar 8 (Anchors):** Veracity Anchor now links verified ESG report

### Why This Integration Matters

**The pillars create a complete evidentiary chain:**

1. **Epistemic Hold (Pillar 1)** detects complexity → triggers pause
2. **Goukassian Principle (Pillar 3)** documents reasoning → creates accountability
3. **Decision Logs (Pillar 4)** records everything → enables audit
4. **Immutable Ledger (Pillar 2)** stores permanently → prevents tampering
5. **Mandates (Pillars 5 & 6)** enforce standards → ensures compliance
6. **Hybrid Shield (Pillar 7)** balances privacy → maintains transparency
7. **Anchors (Pillar 8)** grounds in reality → provides decentralized proof

**Result:** Every action becomes a complete narrative with intent, justification, verification, and immutable proof.

## Practical Implementation

### Code Example: Full Integration

```python
from ternary_logic import TLEngine, verify_mandate, calculate_confidence

# Initialize engine with institutional thresholds
engine = TLEngine(
    proceed_threshold=0.85,
    hold_threshold=0.40,
    epistemic_hold_rate_target=0.20
)

# Transaction data
transaction = {
    'amount': 10_000_000,
    'type': 'trade_financing',
    'client': 'renewable_energy_corp',
    
    # Pillar 5: Economic Rights data
    'ownership_verified': True,
    'consent_obtained': True,
    'provenance_signed': True,
    'regulatory_access': True,
    
    # Pillar 6: Sustainable Capital data
    'esg_verified': False,  # ← PROBLEM
    'emissions_anchored': True,
    'use_of_proceeds_tracked': True,
    
    # Data for confidence calculation
    'data_sources': [
        {'name': 'credit_bureau', 'quality': 0.95, 'confidence': 0.90},
        {'name': 'market_data', 'quality': 0.85, 'confidence': 0.88}
    ],
    'models': [
        {'name': 'model_a', 'output': 0.89},
        {'name': 'model_b', 'output': 0.87},
        {'name': 'model_c', 'output': 0.88}
    ]
}

# Step 1: Check Economic Rights mandate (Pillar 5)
rights_result = verify_mandate('economic_rights', transaction)
if rights_result.state == TLState.EPISTEMIC_HOLD:
    print(f"HOLD: {rights_result.reasoning}")
    # Log to Pillar 2 (Immutable Ledger), Pillar 4 (Decision Logs)
    # Create Pillar 3 (Goukassian Principle) trace
    exit()

# Step 2: Check Sustainable Capital mandate (Pillar 6)
sustainability_result = verify_mandate('sustainable_capital', transaction)
if sustainability_result.state == TLState.EPISTEMIC_HOLD:
    print(f"HOLD: {sustainability_result.reasoning}")
    # → This will trigger because esg_verified = False
    
    # Pillar 1: Epistemic Hold activated
    # Pillar 3: Create Always Memory Log
    # Pillar 4: Record in Decision Logs
    # Pillar 2: Write to Immutable Ledger
    
    # Wait for ESG verification...
    # (In production, this would pause transaction and notify compliance team)
    exit()

# Step 3: Calculate composite confidence
confidence = calculate_confidence(
    transaction['data_sources'],
    transaction['models']
)

# Step 4: Evaluate with TL engine
decision = engine.evaluate(
    confidence=confidence,
    reasoning=f"Trade financing decision for ${transaction['amount']:,}",
    metadata=transaction
)

# Step 5: Act on decision
if decision.state == TLState.PROCEED:
    print(f"✓ PROCEED - Confidence: {decision.confidence:.3f}")
    # Execute transaction
    # Record on Pillar 2 (Immutable Ledger)
    
elif decision.state == TLState.EPISTEMIC_HOLD:
    print(f"⚠ HOLD - Confidence: {decision.confidence:.3f}")
    print(f"Reason: {decision.reasoning}")
    # Pillar 1: Hold for additional review
    # Pillar 3: Create deliberation trace
    # Pillar 4: Log hold event
    
else:  # HALT
    print(f"✗ HALT - Confidence: {decision.confidence:.3f}")
    print(f"Reason: {decision.reasoning}")
    # Reject transaction
    # Record rejection on Pillar 2

# Step 6: Export audit trail
engine.export_audit_trail('/ledger/transaction_audit.json')
```

## Summary: Answering the Critical Questions

### Q1: Who decides trigger levels?

**Answer:**
1. **Technical Committee** (data scientists, risk managers) - Proposes thresholds via backtesting
2. **Governance Anchor/Board** - Approves institutional risk appetite
3. **Regulators** - Set minimum mandatory thresholds
4. **Framework Protocol** - Defines non-negotiable mandate triggers

### Q2: How are thresholds established?

**Answer:**
1. **Historical backtesting** - Optimize for minimum cost (false positives + false negatives)
2. **Regulatory constraints** - Comply with Basel III, FATF, SEC requirements
3. **Institutional policy** - Board-approved risk tolerance
4. **Market adaptation** - Dynamic adjustment for volatility
5. **Mandate enforcement** - Binary pass/fail on verification

### Q3: When does TL know Decision Logs hit complexity?

**Answer:**
Decision Logs capture **all inputs** to confidence calculation in real-time:

- **Data Quality Score** - Missing, stale, or unverified data → Logs record which fields failed
- **Model Agreement Score** - High variance (>30%) → Logs record which models disagreed
- **Historical Accuracy** - Recent poor performance → Logs record prediction outcomes
- **Signal Strength** - Mixed/unclear signals → Logs record indicator conflicts
- **Mandate Failures** - Binary checks fail → Logs record which verification failed

**Complexity detection is automatic and real-time** through continuous monitoring of these factors. When composite confidence falls below PROCEED threshold (0.85) or mandate check fails, Epistemic Hold triggers immediately.

### Q4: How do the eight pillars work together?

**Answer:**
1. **Epistemic Hold** - Detects and enforces pause
2. **Immutable Ledger** - Records complete transaction history
3. **Goukassian Principle** - Documents reasoning during pause
4. **Decision Logs** - Captures all signals and calculations
5. **Economic Rights** - Mandates ownership verification (auto-trigger)
6. **Sustainable Capital** - Mandates ESG verification (auto-trigger)
7. **Hybrid Shield** - Balances privacy with transparency
8. **Anchors** - Provides governance, interoperability, real-world grounding

**Together:** They create a complete, verifiable, auditable decision chain from intent (+1) through deliberation (0) to outcome (+1 or -1).

---

## Conclusion

The Ternary Logic Framework transforms financial decision-making from binary execution into thoughtful, verifiable, accountable processes. Thresholds are not arbitrary—they are derived from rigorous backtesting, regulatory requirements, and institutional risk tolerance. The eight pillars work synergistically to ensure that every decision, especially those in the uncertainty zone, receives appropriate deliberation and creates a complete audit trail.

**The system knows when complexity hits because Decision Logs capture every signal in real-time.** When confidence falls or mandates fail, Epistemic Hold triggers automatically, creating space for human wisdom in a world of algorithmic speed.
