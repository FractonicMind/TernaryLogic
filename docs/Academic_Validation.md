## 📐 Research Methodology

### Theoretical Foundation

#### **Mathematical Framework**
The Ternary Logic system operates on three discrete states:
- **+1 (Proceed)**: Confidence threshold exceeded, uncertainty manageable
- **0 (Epistemic Hold)**: Uncertainty exceeds threshold, deliberation required  
- **-1 (Halt)**: Risk threshold exceeded, defensive action needed

#### **Decision Algorithm**
```
TL_Decision(scenario) = {
    +1  if uncertainty_level < proceed_threshold AND risk_level < risk_tolerance
    -1  if risk_level > halt_threshold OR systematic_risk_detected
    0   otherwise (Epistemic Hold - deliberation required)
}
```

#### **Uncertainty Quantification**
The framework incorporates multiple uncertainty dimensions:
- **Market Volatility**: Statistical measures of price/return volatility
- **Information Asymmetry**: Completeness and reliability of available data
- **Systematic Risk**: Broader economic and systemic stability indicators
- **Temporal Sensitivity**: Time-dependent factors affecting decision quality

## 🎓 Academic Foundations

### Philosophical Underpinnings

#### **Epistemic Humility**
The framework embodies the principle that acknowledging uncertainty is often more intelligent than forcing premature decisions. This aligns with:
- **Behavioral Economics**: Recognition of cognitive limitations in decision-making
- **Austrian School**: Emphasis on incomplete information and market process
- **Keynesian Economics**: Importance of uncertainty and expectations

#### **Decision Theory Extensions**
TL extends traditional binary decision theory by:
- **Introducing Deliberation States**: Formal recognition of "not yet decidable" scenarios
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Systematic measurement of decision confidence
- **Risk-Uncertainty Distinction**: Separating quantifiable risks from fundamental uncertainty
