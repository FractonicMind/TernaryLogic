# Ternary Logic Framework - License FAQ

**MIT License with Ethical Use Requirements**

*Last Updated: November 2025*

---

## 📋 Basic License Questions

### 1. What license is the Ternary Logic Framework under?
**MIT License with Ethical Use Requirements.** You get all the freedoms of MIT (copy, modify, sell) **plus** an extra clause that requires ethical implementation aligned with TL's accountability mission.

### 2. Can I use this code in a commercial product?
Yes—deploy it, sell it, SaaS it—**as long as** the implementation maintains the integrity of the Eight Pillars and doesn't subvert accountability mechanisms.

### 3. Do I have to open-source my own product?
No. MIT allows private forks and closed-source derivatives. However, the **Goukassian Principle (Pillar 3)** requires operational transparency through Decision Logs.

### 4. How must I credit the original author?
Include **exactly** this line in source headers, documentation, or about screens:
```
Ternary Logic Framework © Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)
```

### 5. Can I change the license in my fork?
You can **add** compatible licenses, but you **cannot** remove the MIT + Ethical Use text or compromise the Eight Pillars architecture.

## ⚖️ Ethical Use Guidelines

### 6. What counts as "Ethical Use"?
Any implementation that:
- Preserves the integrity of **Epistemic Hold** (doesn't bypass uncertainty management)
- Maintains **Immutable Ledger** integrity (no retroactive tampering)
- Respects the **Goukassian Principle** (full Eight Pillars binding)
- Creates genuine **accountability** rather than accountability theater
- Benefits stakeholders through transparency, not exploitation

### 7. What counts as "Unethical Use"?
**Subverting accountability mechanisms:**
- Bypassing Epistemic Hold to force risky decisions
- Tampering with Immutable Ledgers
- Creating fake Decision Logs to pass audits
- Using partial pillars while claiming "TL compliance"

**Exploitative financial practices:**
- Market manipulation, spoofing, wash-trading
- Predatory lending or discriminatory algorithms
- High-frequency trading designed to disadvantage retail investors
- ESG greenwashing (violating Pillar 6: Sustainable Capital)

**Privacy violations:**
- Misusing Hybrid Shield (Pillar 7) to expose protected data
- Surveillance without consent
- Selling decision data without authorization

### 8. Who decides if my use is unethical?
The **Tri-cameral Governance Model**:
1. **Technical Council** - Evaluates technical compliance
2. **Stewardship Custodians** - Assesses ethical alignment
3. **Smart Contract Safeguard** - Automated enforcement

Decisions are published transparently with full reasoning.

### 9. How is enforcement carried out?
**Progressive enforcement model:**
1. **Warning** - Private notification with remediation guidance
2. **Public Notice** - Listed in violation registry if not remedied
3. **License Revocation** - Loss of right to use TL trademark/claims
4. **Community Alert** - Warning to regulators and partners

**Note:** No monetary damages sought - enforcement focuses on protecting TL integrity.

### 10. How do I request an ethics review?
Submit to **ethics@tl-goukassian.org** with:
- Description of your use case
- How you implement the Eight Pillars
- Any concerns about ethical compliance
- Proposed mitigations if applicable

Reviews typically complete within 30 days.

## 💼 Commercial and Distribution

### 11. Can I implement only some of the Eight Pillars?
**For pilots/testing:** Yes, but must be clearly labeled as "TL-Inspired" not "TL-Compliant"  
**For production:** No. The Goukassian Principle requires all Eight Pillars for authentic TL.

### 12. Can I embed TL in proprietary software?
Yes, but you must:
- Maintain attribution
- Preserve Eight Pillars integrity
- Allow audit access to Decision Logs (Pillar 4)
- Not claim "TL Compliance" without full implementation

### 13. What about white-label or OEM use?
Permitted, but:
- End users must know TL powers the system
- Eight Pillars must remain intact
- Ethical use requirements transfer to all deployments
- Cannot rebrand as a different accountability framework

### 14. Can cloud providers host TL implementations?
Yes. Infrastructure providers aren't responsible for end-user compliance, but should:
- Not knowingly enable violations
- Respond to validated violation reports
- Maintain service terms aligned with ethical use

### 15. How does licensing work for government use?
**Government use is encouraged** with special provisions:
- Sovereign implementations can adapt to local law
- Classification requirements can use modified Hybrid Shield
- Public benefit use presumed ethical
- Transparency requirements may be adjusted for national security

## 🎓 Academic and Research Use

### 16. Can I use TL in academic papers?
**Highly encouraged.** Please cite:
```bibtex
@article{goukassian2025tl,
  author = {Goukassian, Lev},
  title = {Ternary Logic: Implementing Epistemic Hold in Economic Systems},
  year = {2025},
  note = {Framework for sovereign-grade evidentiary accountability}
}
```

### 17. Can I modify TL for research?
Yes, for research you can:
- Experiment with modified pillars
- Test alternative architectures
- Explore domain adaptations
- Publish comparative studies

Just clearly label modifications and don't claim unmodified TL compliance.

### 18. What about the test scenarios and datasets?
The **25+ professional scenarios** inherit the same MIT + Ethical Use license. Academic use is unrestricted.

### 19. Can I teach TL in courses?
**Absolutely!** Educational materials available:
- Lecture slides templates
- Assignment frameworks
- Case studies
- Implementation exercises

## 🏛️ Eight Pillars Compliance

### 20. Must I implement all Eight Pillars?
For **production TL compliance**: Yes, all eight are required.
For **research/testing**: Subset implementations allowed with clear labeling.

### 21. Can I modify how pillars work?
You can **configure** thresholds and parameters.
You cannot **compromise** core functionality:
- Epistemic Hold must pause on uncertainty
- Immutable Ledger must prevent tampering
- Goukassian Principle must bind all pillars
- Etc.

### 22. What if my domain doesn't need all pillars?
Even if unused, pillars must be **available and functional**. Example: A system might rarely trigger Epistemic Hold, but the capability must exist.

### 23. How do I verify Eight Pillars compliance?
Use the provided validation suite:
```python
from tl_framework.validation import ComplianceValidator
validator = ComplianceValidator()
report = validator.validate_eight_pillars(your_implementation)
```

- Any "black box" algorithm needing transparency

### 26. Can I use TL for surveillance?
**Only with proper safeguards:**

## 🏛️ Governance and Succession

### 28. What happens to the license after succession?
The **succession trustees** (MIT, Stanford, Chicago, LSE, BIS, World Bank, IMF) maintain license terms but may:
- Clarify ethical guidelines
- Update for new technologies
- Respond to regulatory changes
- Never weaken accountability requirements

### 29. Can ethical requirements be removed?
**No.** The ethical use clause is perpetual and irrevocable. It's core to Lev's vision and the framework's purpose.

### 30. How are violations reported?
**Report to:** violations@tl-goukassian.org
**Include:**
- Evidence of violation
- Affected parties

## 💙 Memorial and Legacy

### 31. Why the ethical use requirement?
Lev Goukassian created TL during his battle with terminal illness as his final gift to humanity. The ethical clause ensures his vision of **"making truth mathematically provable"** isn't perverted for harm.

### 32. How does this honor the creator's memory?
Every ethical implementation advances the vision that **"when truth becomes measurable, power has nowhere left to hide."** Each proper use of TL makes the world more accountable and transparent.

### 33. What would violate the spirit of TL?
- Using transparency as a weapon rather than a shield
- Creating accountability theater without substance
- Exploiting the framework's trust for deception
- Claiming TL compliance without implementing its principles
