# üî¥ MANDATORY - Critical Requirements for Ternary Logic Framework

**READ THIS DOCUMENT IN FULL BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION**

> **Warning**: Improper implementation of the Ternary Logic Framework in economic decision-making systems can result in significant financial losses, missed opportunities, and systematic failures. This document contains **mandatory requirements** that must be understood and followed.

---

## üìå Executive Summary

The Ternary Logic Framework introduces a **third state** to decision-making:

- **PROCEED (+1)**: Clear positive signals, confidence exceeds threshold
- **HOLD (0)**: Epistemic uncertainty requires more information
- **HALT (-1)**: Clear negative signals, risk exceeds threshold

**The HOLD state is NOT**:
- ‚ùå Indecision or weakness
- ‚ùå A default when unsure what to do
- ‚ùå A way to avoid responsibility
- ‚ùå A temporary state to be quickly resolved

**The HOLD state IS**:
- ‚úÖ An active, deliberate choice
- ‚úÖ Recognition of epistemic uncertainty
- ‚úÖ A protective mechanism against premature decisions
- ‚úÖ A signal that more information has positive expected value

---

## ‚ö° Critical Requirements

### 1. State Classification Requirements

#### **PROCEED (+1) State**
**MUST** only be activated when ALL conditions are met:
- Confidence level > calibrated threshold (default 0.7)
- Risk score < calibrated threshold (default 0.3)
- No systematic risk indicators present
- Information completeness > 60%

**Common Mistakes**:
- ‚ùå Proceeding with high confidence but incomplete information
- ‚ùå Ignoring correlation risks in favorable conditions
- ‚ùå Threshold gaming to force PROCEED decisions

#### **HOLD (0) State - The Epistemic Hold**
**MUST** be activated when ANY condition is met:
- Confidence ‚àà [0.4, 0.7] (uncertainty band)
- Information completeness < 60%
- Conflicting signals from different indicators
- Regime change detected but not confirmed
- Cost of waiting < expected value of information

**Common Mistakes**:
- ‚ùå Treating HOLD as a failure to decide
- ‚ùå Setting arbitrary time limits on HOLD states
- ‚ùå Forcing binary decision when HOLD is appropriate

#### **HALT (-1) State**
**MUST** be activated when ANY condition is met:
- Risk score > calibrated threshold (default 0.7)
- Systematic risk indicators present
- Confidence level < 0.3
- Emergency conditions detected

**Common Mistakes**:
- ‚ùå Delaying HALT when clear risks are present
- ‚ùå Confusing HOLD with HALT
- ‚ùå Not having clear HALT exit strategies

## üéØ Mandatory Implementation Standards

### 2. Threshold Calibration Requirements

**You MUST**:
1. **Calibrate thresholds for your specific domain**
   - Financial trading: Higher confidence required (0.75+)
   - Policy decisions: Lower confidence acceptable (0.65+)
   - Supply chain: Context-dependent (0.6-0.8)

2. **Validate thresholds with historical data**
   - Minimum 100 historical decisions required
   - Backtesting must show improvement over binary logic
   - Document all calibration decisions

3. **Implement adaptive thresholds**
   ```python
   # MANDATORY: Thresholds must adapt to market conditions
   if volatility > historical_95th_percentile:
       confidence_threshold *= 1.1  # Require more confidence
       risk_threshold *= 0.9        # Lower risk tolerance
   ```

### 3. Testing Requirements

**Before ANY production deployment, you MUST**:

‚úÖ **Pass all 53 framework tests**
```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=src/goukassian --cov-fail-under=80
```

‚úÖ **Implement domain-specific tests** covering:
- Boundary conditions at thresholds
- State transition logic
- Emergency override mechanisms
- Performance under stress conditions

‚úÖ **Document test results** including:
- Accuracy vs binary systems
- False positive/negative rates
- Average time in HOLD state
- Economic impact assessment

## üö® Critical Safety Mechanisms

### 4. Required Safety Features

**Every implementation MUST include**:

1. **Emergency Override**
   ```python
   # MANDATORY: Emergency override to HALT
   if emergency_indicators.any():
       return TLState.HALT  # Override all other logic
   ```

2. **Maximum HOLD Duration**
   ```python
   # MANDATORY: Prevent infinite HOLD
   if time_in_hold > max_hold_duration:
       if risk > confidence:
           return TLState.HALT
       else:
           log_forced_decision()
           return TLState.PROCEED if confidence > 0.5 else TLState.HALT
   ```

3. **Audit Trail**
   ```python
   # MANDATORY: Complete decision logging
   log_decision({
       'timestamp': now(),
       'state': decision_state,
       'confidence': confidence_score,
       'risk': risk_score,
       'factors': all_input_factors,
       'thresholds': current_thresholds,
       'override': was_overridden
   })
   ```

## üìä Mandatory Metrics and Monitoring

### 5. Required Monitoring

**You MUST track**:

| Metric | Acceptable Range | Action if Outside Range |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| HOLD state percentage | 15-40% | Recalibrate thresholds |
| State transition frequency | < 10% per hour | Investigate instability |
| Override frequency | < 5% | Review override triggers |
| Decision latency | < 100ms | Optimize implementation |
| Accuracy vs baseline | > 10% improvement | Review implementation |

### 6. Required Reporting

**Monthly reports MUST include**:
- Distribution of states (pie chart)
- State transition matrix
- Economic impact analysis
- Threshold adjustment history
- Any systematic bias detected

---

## ‚õî Prohibited Practices

**You MUST NOT**:

‚ùå **Remove or bypass the HOLD state** - This fundamentally breaks the framework

‚ùå **Use static thresholds in production** - Markets change, thresholds must adapt

‚ùå **Implement without backtesting** - Historical validation is mandatory

‚ùå **Mix TL with binary logic** - Either full TL or no TL, no hybrid approaches

‚ùå **Ignore warning indicators** - All risk signals must be processed

‚ùå **Deploy without monitoring** - Real-time monitoring is required

**Remember**: The Epistemic Hold is not hesitation‚Äîit is wisdom in action. When uncertainty is high, the most intelligent decision is often to wait for clarity. This framework gives you permission and structure to do exactly that.
