##  Testing Overview

### Testing Philosophy

The Ternary Logic framework requires **rigorous testing** due to its application in critical economic decision-making contexts. Our testing approach ensures:

- __Decision Accuracy__ Correct +1/0/-1 state classification across scenarios
- __Threshold Sensitivity__ Proper behavior at confidence and risk boundaries  
- __Edge Case Handling__ Robust performance under extreme market conditions
- __Performance Validation__ Consistent execution speed and memory usage
- __Integration Stability__ Reliable operation with financial and policy systems

##  Test Implementation Details

### Current Status

All tests are currently implemented with **mock objects** to validate the framework structure and test suite functionality. The mock implementation:

-  Validates the three-state logic (PROCEED/HOLD/HALT)
-  Tests confidence and risk thresholds
-  Simulates realistic decision-making scenarios
-  Provides performance benchmarks

### Migration to Production

When implementing the actual TL framework:

1. **Update imports in `conftest.py`**:
   ```python
   from goukassian.core import TernaryLogicEngine
   from goukassian.uncertainty import UncertaintyDetector
   from goukassian.risk import RiskAssessment
   ```

2. **Replace mock implementations** with actual modules

3. **Maintain test interfaces** - tests should work without modification

4. **Add domain-specific implementations** for:
   - Supply chain management
   - API endpoints
   - Advanced scenarios
