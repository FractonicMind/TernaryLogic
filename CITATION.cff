title: "Ternary Logic Framework: Intelligent Economic Decision-Making Under Uncertainty"
abstract: "A comprehensive framework for economic decision-making that introduces intelligent uncertainty management through the Epistemic Hold mechanism. The framework extends traditional binary decision-making with a third state that acknowledges when situations require deliberation rather than immediate action. Proven effective across financial trading, monetary policy, supply chain management, and other economic domains with demonstrated improvements in decision accuracy and risk management."
