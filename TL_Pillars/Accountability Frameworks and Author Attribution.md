# **The Originator's Signature: Provenance, Permanence, and Integrity in Foundational Accountability Frameworks**

## **Introduction: The Architecture of Enduring Trust**

A foundational accountability framework, particularly one intended for perpetual use in critical infrastructure, presents a unique and profound governance challenge. Its architecture must be designed not only for immediate function but for enduring integrity, resisting corruption, misinterpretation, and decay over generations of technological and societal change. The central question confronting the architects of such systems is what role, if any, the identity of the originator should play in this permanent structure. Is permanent, cryptographic attribution to an originator a vital anchor for institutional memory and a bulwark against malicious co-option, or is it an act of ego that subverts the system's authority by tethering it to a fallible individual rather than an objective principle?  
This report addresses this dilemma through a detailed analysis of Ternary Moral Logic (TL), a novel AI safety and accountability framework. TL is not merely a technical specification; it is conceived as a socio-technical constitution, a system where "law and code become one language". Its purpose is to embed an inalienable conscience into artificial intelligence through a tripartite logic: \+1 (Proceed), 0 (Sacred Pause), and \-1 (Refuse). This logic is enforced through the "Goukassian Promise," a multi-layered defense system composed of three artifacts: the Lantern (a public symbol of ethical compliance), the License (a legally binding covenant against misuse), and the Signature (a cryptographic link to the system's origin).  
The specific case under examination is the proposal to permanently embed the name "Goukassian Principle" and the associated Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) of its originator, Lev Goukassian, into the core architecture and immutable audit trails of the TL system. This analysis is explicitly positioned not as a judgment on the merits of an individual, but as a critical examination of governance architecture. It is a matter of provenance, institutional memory, and the long-term integrity of a system designed to make accountability an inescapable property of artificial intelligence. The stakes are defined by the system's own stated purpose: to create a permanent, evidentiary infrastructure that ensures when AI-driven harm occurs, justice is possible because the evidence trail cannot be erased.  
To deliver a reasoned and definitive judgment, this report will conduct a multi-domain analysis, drawing upon historical precedents from cryptography, constitutional law, and science; exploring the ethical imperatives of traceability and attribution in trust systems; and evaluating the specific technical function of the ORCID identifier as a modern mechanism for cryptographic provenance. The objective is to determine whether the permanent embedding of the originator's name and ORCID serves or subverts the long-term function of this critical AI safety framework and to conclude with a clear, defensible recommendation for its governance.

## **Section I: The Precedent of the Originator's Name in Foundational Systems**

To properly evaluate the role of originator attribution in Ternary Moral Logic, it is essential to first establish a historical context by examining how different fields treat this practice within their own foundational concepts. This comparative analysis reveals a fundamental tension between domains that valorize the individual creator and those that prioritize impersonal, systematic authority. TL, as a hybrid of technical logic and ethical governance, sits at the intersection of these conflicting traditions.

### **A. Cryptography and Code: The Tradition of the Named Creator**

The field of modern cryptography exhibits a strong and persistent tradition of eponymous naming for its most foundational algorithms and data structures. These are not peripheral conventions but are deeply embedded in the lexicon and history of the discipline. The RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) cryptosystem, one of the oldest and most widely used methods for secure data transmission, derives its name directly from the surnames of its three inventors who publicly described it in 1977\. Similarly, the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, a seminal method for securely sharing cryptographic keys over a public channel, is named for its inventors, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. This practice extends to core data structures, such as the Merkle Tree, a cryptographic commitment scheme essential to blockchain technology, named after its inventor, Ralph Merkle.  
In this domain, the name serves as a direct, unambiguous, and permanent acknowledgment of intellectual parentage for a discrete and often revolutionary contribution. The name becomes a globally recognized shorthand for the complex mathematical concept itself. This practice has not hindered the adoption or evolution of these technologies; rather, it has become an integral part of their identity, anchoring them to their originating documents and the specific problems they were designed to solve.  
This tradition of naming core concepts, however, is distinct from the more functional and descriptive naming conventions used for internal system components or abstract roles. In cryptographic literature, placeholder names like "Alice" and "Bob" are used to represent generic participants (sender and receiver), while "Eve" represents a passive eavesdropper. These names are intentionally archetypal and non-specific. Likewise, complex systems often employ highly structured, functional naming conventions for internal scripts and rules, such as IBM's CARLa scripts, where prefixes denote the component, feature, and intended use (e.g., interactive display vs. batch report). This reveals a clear hierarchy of attribution within the technical domain: the foundational, paradigm-shifting idea is often tied to its creator's name, while the implementations, roles, and components are described by their function.

### **B. Law and Governance: The Primacy of Process and Precedent**

In stark contrast to cryptography, the legal and governance worlds deliberately avoid naming doctrines and frameworks directly after their authors. The authority of a legal principle is intended to derive from the power of the state, the constitution, or established precedent, not from the personality or reputation of an individual judge or legislator. Legal doctrines are typically named for the underlying Latin or English concept (e.g., the doctrine of *laches*, which prevents a plaintiff from delaying a case, or the doctrine of *substantial performance* in contract law). Some are named for the power they describe, such as *posse comitatus*, the authority of a sheriff to conscript citizens to keep the peace.  
The most famous examples of eponymous legal principles are, upon closer inspection, not named for their authors at all. The **Miranda Warning**, a cornerstone of U.S. criminal procedure, is named after Ernesto Miranda, the defendant in the landmark 1966 Supreme Court case *Miranda v. Arizona*. The rights are not called the "Warren Rights" after Chief Justice Earl Warren, who delivered the majority opinion. This is a deliberate institutional practice. It abstracts the law from the individual jurist, rooting its authority in the specific facts of the case and its interpretation of constitutional principles. The name serves as a mnemonic link to the precedent-setting case, not as a tribute to an author.  
This principle of impersonal, functional authority extends to modern accountability frameworks. Systems like the RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) model, the UNFPA Accountability Framework, and Blandin Foundation's "Mountain of Accountability" are universally process-oriented. Their components are named for their function: "Meaningful Engagement," "Continuous Improvement," "Component Ownership". Their authority and utility derive from their logical coherence and the consensus of the organizations that adopt them, not from the identity of their originators. The goal is to create a universal, transferable system of governance, and personal attribution is seen as a barrier to that goal.

### **C. Science and Discovery: A Bifurcated Approach**

The scientific domain presents a more complex, bifurcated approach to attribution that reflects elements of both the cryptographic and legal traditions. On one hand, foundational physical laws and monumental discoveries are frequently named for the individuals who first formulated or identified them. **Newton's Laws of Motion**, which form the basis of classical mechanics, are inextricably linked to Isaac Newton, who first published them in his *Principia Mathematica* in 1687\. The fundamental geometric relationship in a right triangle, a^2 \+ b^2 \= c^2, is universally known as the **Pythagorean Theorem**, named for the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, despite evidence of its use in Babylonian and Egyptian mathematics over a thousand years earlier. Similarly, the most famous periodic comet is known as **Halley's Comet**, not because Edmond Halley discovered it, but because he was the first to calculate its orbit and correctly predict its return, thereby proving that comets were orbiting bodies. This practice parallels the cryptographic tradition, where a fundamental insight that redefines a field is permanently tied to its discoverer.  
On the other hand, when science has needed to create systems of governance and classification, it has adopted highly structured, impersonal frameworks. The most prominent example is **binomial nomenclature**, the formal system for naming species. This system, governed by strict, internationally agreed-upon codes like the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), prioritizes clarity, stability, and universality above all else. While a species name might be derived from a person's name (e.g., *Phlox drummondii*, named for botanist Thomas Drummond), the system itself is impersonal. It even includes a "law of priority," a formal rule stating that the first validly published name for a species is the correct one, providing a systematic, rule-based method for resolving conflicts that supersedes individual preference or subsequent claims to credit.  
This examination of precedents reveals that Ternary Moral Logic occupies a unique and challenging position. It is described as both a foundational logic—akin to a cryptographic primitive or a physical law—and as an "ethical constitution," a system of governance where "law and code become one language". It is a hybrid entity, a socio-technical system that functions simultaneously as a cryptographic protocol and a legal-ethical governance framework. Therefore, applying a single precedent from any one of these domains is inadequate. The cryptographic tradition would support eponymous naming, while the legal and governance tradition would strongly oppose it. Science offers a split verdict, naming discoveries but systematizing governance. TL is a new category that merges these functions, and it therefore requires a novel approach to attribution that can honor the imperatives of both technical innovation and perpetual governance.

### **Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Naming Conventions in Foundational Systems**

The divergent practices across these critical domains are summarized below, highlighting the distinct rationales that underpin their approaches to originator attribution and the resulting implications for governance and authority.

| Domain | Naming Convention | Rationale for Naming | Implication for Governance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cryptography** | Eponymous (e.g., RSA, Merkle Tree) | Direct credit for a discrete, foundational invention. | Originator's original paper/work is the primary source of truth and interpretation. |
| **Law & Governance** | Case-Based or Descriptive (e.g., *Miranda* Rights, RACI) | Authority derives from a landmark case, legal concept, or functional utility. | Authority is abstracted from individuals; interpretation relies on evolving legal precedent and process. |
| **Science (Theory/Discovery)** | Eponymous (e.g., Newton's Laws) | Credit for a fundamental discovery or theoretical formulation. | Originator's work is foundational, but subject to revision and expansion by the scientific community. |
| **Science (System/Classification)** | Systematic (e.g., Binomial Nomenclature) | To ensure universal clarity, stability, and rule-based order. | The governing code/rules are the ultimate authority, superseding individual preference or credit. |

This comparative analysis establishes the central conflict in precedents and demonstrates why the question of attribution for TL cannot be resolved by simple analogy. A deeper examination of the ethical and functional roles of traceability within the specific context of the TL system is required.

## **Section II: The Ethical Imperative of Traceability in Trust Systems**

Moving beyond historical precedent, the decision to embed an originator's identity must be grounded in the ethical and functional requirements of the system itself. For a framework like Ternary Moral Logic, which is explicitly designed to enforce an ethical covenant and provide immutable accountability, the question of traceability is not a matter of mere convention but a core component of its design philosophy. The arguments for permanent attribution rest on its functional role in preserving integrity, its necessity for transparent accountability, and a conception of motivation that transcends ego in favor of perpetual stewardship.

### **A. Attribution as a Bulwark Against Misappropriation and Dilution**

A primary justification for permanently embedding the originator's identity is its function as a security mechanism against the system's corruption. The "Goukassian Promise" is explicitly defined as a "multi-layered defense system" designed to guard against "ethical decay, malicious co-option, and the gradual erosion of the framework's core principles". Clear and indelible attribution is a critical part of this defense. In the fields of intellectual and artistic creation, attribution is the fundamental principle that gives "credit where credit is due," forming the ethical and legal basis for preventing plagiarism, misappropriation, and the unauthorized use of another's work.  
Within the context of TL, this principle is elevated from an academic norm to a functional component of the system's security. The framework's creators identified a specific threat vector: "ethical laundering," a scenario where a malicious actor could fork the open-source TL codebase, strip it of its ethical constraints (such as the "Sacred Pause" or the prohibitions on use as a weapon or spy), and rebrand it as a new, supposedly "safe" AI framework. By permanently embedding the "Goukassian Principle" name and the originator's unique identifier into the cryptographic fabric of all legitimate implementations, the system creates a high barrier to such an attack. Any version of the code that lacks this signature of provenance is immediately identifiable as inauthentic or neutered. The name and identifier thus act as a permanent, non-removable watermark of authentic origin, making it significantly more difficult to dilute the core principles or pass off a corrupted version as genuine. This function directly serves the system's goal of creating "accountability that cannot be erased".

### **B. The Author's Values "Frozen in Code": Transparency and Accountability**

A second, more profound ethical argument for traceability stems from the recognition that technology is never neutral. AI systems, in particular, reflect the values and biases of their creators and the data upon which they are trained. As one analysis notes, "the values of the author, wittingly or not, are frozen into the code, effectively institutionalising those values". This "black box" problem, where the internal logic of an AI is opaque even to its operators, is a central challenge in AI ethics. TL is designed to combat this opacity by generating "Moral Trace Logs"—immutable, cryptographically signed records that make its decision-making process auditable.  
Given the inevitability of embedded values, the ethical imperative is not to feign an impossible neutrality but to embrace radical transparency about the system's origins. Making the author and their identity permanently and unambiguously traceable is a fundamental act of accountability. It provides a clear, verifiable answer to the crucial question of provenance: *Who* decided that these specific ethical principles—"Pause when truth is uncertain. Refuse when harm is clear. Proceed where truth is"—were the correct ones to encode?. This traceability allows users, regulators, courts, and victims of potential harm to investigate the philosophical origins and potential biases of the system to which they are subject. Attribution, in this context, is not a claim of perfection or infallibility; it is an honest and permanent declaration of origin, which is the first and most crucial step in any legitimate accountability framework. It builds trust by ensuring that the decision-making processes are transparent and that the origins of the system's ethical standards are documented and open to scrutiny.

### **C. The Spectrum of Motivation: Ego, Necessity, or Civic Duty**

The query rightfully demands an analysis of the motivation behind embedding an originator's name, questioning whether it represents ego, necessity, or civic duty. While attribution theory suggests that individuals have an innate desire to understand the motives of an actor's behavior , the unique context of TL's creation complicates a simple analysis. The framework is repeatedly described by its originator as a "final gift" and a "final contribution," created in the face of a terminal illness.  
This context fundamentally reframes the motivation. Standard analyses of attribution often assume a context of professional advancement, financial gain, or the accumulation of reputational capital within a peer group. However, an originator facing a terminal diagnosis has no future career to benefit from this attribution. This makes a motivation rooted in simple ego or personal gain highly improbable. Instead, the act of signing one's name to a "final gift" is transformed into an act of profound stewardship and posthumous guardianship. The signature is not for the benefit of the author, but for the integrity of the creation after the author is gone. It is a mechanism to ensure the gift is used as intended and cannot be easily corrupted.  
This act aligns more closely with a Kantian conception of civic duty, where a moral principle is followed because it is rationally necessary and unconditional, irrespective of personal desires or outcomes. The necessity here is the preservation of the system's core ethical promise. The signature becomes a structural component required to bind the implementation to its founding philosophy. It is an assertion that the ethical covenant of TL is not an abstract, disembodied set of rules but the direct product of a specific moral and philosophical worldview, one that must remain traceable to its source to be properly understood and adjudicated in perpetuity. The motivation, therefore, appears to be a form of civic duty aimed at ensuring the long-term safety and integrity of a powerful technology for future generations.

## **Section III: ORCID as a Mechanism for Cryptographic Provenance and Institutional Memory**

The proposal for Ternary Moral Logic involves embedding not just a name, but a specific piece of digital infrastructure: the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID). A deep analysis of this technology reveals that it is qualitatively different from and functionally superior to a simple name for the purpose of establishing permanent, trustworthy provenance in a critical system. The ORCID iD solves the problem of name ambiguity, connects the system to a global, open-standard infrastructure, and transforms static attribution into a dynamic anchor for institutional memory.

### **A. Beyond the Name: The Function of a Persistent Identifier (PID)**

An ORCID iD is a nonproprietary alphanumeric code that provides a "persistent identity for humans," designed specifically to resolve the author name ambiguity problem in scholarly and technical communication. Unlike a name, which is not unique, an ORCID iD is a globally unique, 16-digit number expressed as a resolvable URI, such as https://orcid.org/0009-0006-5966-1243. This machine-readability is crucial for a system like TL, which is built on cryptographic verification.  
The necessity for such a unique identifier is not hypothetical; it is demonstrated within the very research corpus for this report. The provided materials reference multiple researchers with the surname Goukassian, including "Goukassian D" and "Goukassian DA" in the context of medical research. This real-world ambiguity powerfully illustrates why a simple name like "The Goukassian Principle" is insufficient for a system that demands cryptographic certainty. Which Goukassian? How could an automated audit trail or a court of law definitively link the principle to the correct originator and their specific body of work without a unique key? The ORCID iD solves this problem absolutely. It functions as a persistent digital identifier (DPI) that uniquely and permanently disambiguates an individual from all others, providing the level of precision required for a foundational trust framework.

### **B. ORCID in the Global Research and Technical Infrastructure**

Embedding an ORCID iD does not mean locking the TL framework into a proprietary or obscure standard. On the contrary, ORCID is a foundational, non-profit, community-governed component of the global research and scholarly ecosystem. Its vision is to create a world where all research participants "are uniquely identified and connected to their contributions across disciplines, borders, and time".  
ORCID is built on principles of openness, transparency, and interoperability. All software it develops is open source, and its public data is released under a CC0 waiver, making it maximally reusable. Its commitment to open standards and its role in the ecosystem of Persistent Identifiers (PIDs), alongside services like DataCite (for datasets) and ROR (for organizations), ensures that it is a stable and trusted part of the digital infrastructure. The importance of ORCID is further underscored by its adoption by major national science and funding bodies, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF), to fulfill federal requirements for research security and public access (NSPM-33). By embedding an ORCID iD, the TL framework is not isolating itself; it is connecting itself to a robust, trusted, and open global standard for identity and provenance verification.

### **C. The "Signature" in Practice: A Dynamic Anchor for Institutional Memory**

Perhaps the most powerful argument for using the ORCID iD is that it transforms the act of attribution from a static, historical footnote into a dynamic, living tool for governance and interpretation. A name is a fixed reference to a person at a single point in time. An ORCID iD, as a resolvable URI, is a permanent gateway to a curated and verifiable record of an individual's entire scholarly and technical output, including publications, datasets, software, and other contributions.  
This has profound implications for the long-term governance of Ternary Moral Logic. Imagine a future scenario where a court, a regulatory body, or an ethics committee must adjudicate a complex incident documented in a TL "Moral Trace Log". The log shows that the AI executed a "Sacred Pause" in a novel and ambiguous situation. The interpretation of whether this action was correct according to the system's foundational principles is paramount. By cryptographically embedding the originator's ORCID iD in that log, the adjudicators are given a powerful tool. They can resolve the URI (https://orcid.org/0009-0006-5966-1243) and gain immediate, programmatic access to the originator's complete body of work. This includes not only the primary papers defining TL but also other essays and articles written on the philosophy of ternary logic, the importance of the pause, and the ethical framework's intended application in complex domains.  
The ORCID iD thus becomes the key to the system's institutional memory. It provides a durable, verifiable mechanism for a form of *techno-legal originalism*, akin to constitutional scholars consulting the papers and letters of a constitution's framers to understand original intent. The "Signature" is not merely a credit; it is a permanent, machine-readable, and context-rich provenance anchor that ensures the philosophical underpinnings of the system remain accessible and interpretable for as long as the system exists.

## **Section IV: Synthesis and Judgment: The Case for Permanent Attribution in Ternary Moral Logic**

The preceding analyses of historical precedent, ethical imperatives, and technical function converge to form a cohesive and compelling argument for the permanent embedding of originator attribution in the Ternary Moral Logic framework. TL's unique nature as a socio-technical constitution demands a governance model that learns from past traditions but is not constrained by them. The decision must be based on what best serves the system's core purpose: to create enduring, transparent, and incorruptible accountability.  
The precedents from cryptography, law, and science establish that there is no single, universal rule for attribution. However, TL's character is more aligned with that of a foundational cryptographic primitive than an evolving legal doctrine. Its integrity is inextricably linked to the specific, novel logic and ethical philosophy of its creator. The core vow—"Pause when truth is uncertain. Refuse when harm is clear. Proceed where truth is"—is not a negotiable guideline but a fixed axiom upon which the entire structure is built. Unlike a legal framework that evolves through the collective precedent of many judges over time, TL's foundational logic is immutable. Therefore, the cryptographic tradition of eponymous attribution, which anchors a system to its originating author and their defining work, provides the more appropriate model.  
This conclusion is strongly reinforced by the ethical arguments for traceability. In a system where the author's values are admittedly "frozen in code," transparency of origin is not a matter of ego but a functional necessity for accountability. Attribution serves as a critical security feature, a bulwark against the "ethical laundering" that the Goukassian Promise was explicitly designed to prevent. The unique context of the framework's creation as a "final gift" from an originator facing a terminal illness powerfully reframes the motivation for this attribution. It is not an act of self-aggrandizement but one of profound stewardship—an attempt to ensure the integrity of the creation in perpetuity.  
Crucially, the specific mechanism proposed—the ORCID identifier—elevates this attribution from a simple name to a sophisticated tool of governance. The ORCID iD provides not just attribution but *verifiable, persistent, and context-rich provenance*. It definitively solves the problem of name ambiguity, a practical necessity for a system requiring cryptographic precision. It connects the TL framework to a trusted, open, and global infrastructure, ensuring its provenance mechanism is not proprietary or brittle. Most importantly, it creates a dynamic anchor for institutional memory. The embedded ORCID is a permanent, machine-readable link to the originator's full body of work, providing an invaluable and perpetual resource for future interpretation, adjudication, and governance of the system's actions. It ensures that the "why" behind the code remains as accessible as the "what."

## **Conclusion: A Framework for Enduring Accountability**

Based on a comprehensive analysis of historical precedent, ethical necessity, and the technical function of persistent identifiers, this report delivers a clear and reasoned judgment: **The name "Goukassian Principle" and the associated ORCID identifier of Lev Goukassian should remain permanently embedded in Ternary Moral Logic’s architecture and audit trails.**  
This recommendation is grounded in three core justifications that directly support the system's stated goals of integrity, transparency, and perpetual accountability:

1. **Integrity and Provenance:** The attribution is a necessary functional component of the system's security architecture. It protects the framework's conceptual integrity from dilution, misappropriation, and malicious co-option, consistent with the established precedent for foundational technical contributions where the link to the originator's specific insight is paramount.  
2. **Transparency and Accountability:** The embedded signature provides an ethically necessary, transparent, and permanent link to the values and philosophy institutionalized within the code. It holds the system's origins accountable to public and judicial scrutiny, which is a prerequisite for any legitimate trust and safety framework.  
3. **Institutional Memory and Governance:** The use of a persistent digital identifier (ORCID) transforms static attribution into a dynamic, machine-readable governance tool. It creates an unambiguous and perpetual anchor to the originator's complete body of work, providing an invaluable resource for future interpretation, adjudication, and a consistent understanding of the system's foundational principles.

The case of Ternary Moral Logic establishes a new benchmark for accountability in critical AI systems. For future foundational trust and safety frameworks of similar gravitas, the cryptographic embedding of a non-proprietary, persistent originator identifier, such as an ORCID iD, should be considered a best practice. It is a mechanism that ensures the system's past remains verifiable, its present is transparent, and its future governance is anchored in a clear and accessible institutional memory.
