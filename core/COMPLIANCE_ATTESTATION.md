## COMPLIANCE ATTESTATION

**Legal Framework:** TL Financial Covenant

### **The TL Vow**

By initializing this runtime, the Operator acknowledges the restrictions of the Ternary Logic framework:  
The Vow:  
"Pause when value is uncertain. Refuse when fraud is clear. Proceed where value is proven."  
"No Anchor, No Liquidity."  
"No Provenance, No Trade."

### **Liability**

* **IF** the system freezes due to **Solvency Violation (C-003)**,  
* **THEN** the entity controlling the keys assumes presumptive liability for Attempted Fraud.  
* The ShutdownRecord is admissible as forensic accounting evidence.
