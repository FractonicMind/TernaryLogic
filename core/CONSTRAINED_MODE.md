## CONSTRAINED MODE

### **Epistemic Hold (State S2)**

When the system enters **Epistemic Hold (0)**, it is not broken; it is *verifying*.  
**Operational Limits:**

* **Trade Lock:** No assets move. Wallets are effectively frozen.  
* **Oracle Scan:** The system aggressively queries secondary and tertiary oracles to resolve the data conflict (e.g., verifying a sudden price drop isn't a sensor glitch).  
* **Transparency:** The system publishes a "Proof of Hold" citing the specific missing data (e.g., "Awaiting Settlement Finality from Bridge X").
