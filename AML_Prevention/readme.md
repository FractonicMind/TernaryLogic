# Ternary Logic (TL) for AML Enforcement

**Governance-Grade System Specification & Economic Integrity Model**

## Overview

This repository contains the complete architectural, economic, and regulatory specifications for **Ternary Logic (TL)**—a triadic state-machine architecture designed to replace legacy binary Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems.

TL shifts financial enforcement from **Post-Hoc Reporting** (probabilistic/reactive) to **Pre-Action Governance** (deterministic/preventative). It introduces the *Epistemic Hold* (State 0), ensuring that no economic value moves across the network until its evidentiary lineage is cryptographically verified.

* **`Structural Anti-Money Laundering Enforcement Via Ternary Logic.html`**: Visual representation of the "Dual-Lane Latency" and "Epistemic Hold" mechanics.

### 📂 03-Regulatory-Compliance

**For Compliance Officers (CCOs), Auditors, and Regulators.**

* **`TL-Regulatory-Mapping-K.docx`**: Exhaustive comparative tables mapping TL controls against **Basel III**, **FATF**, **IOSCO**, **NIST**, and **SOX/COSO** frameworks.
* **`Interactive-Compliance-Matrix.html`**: A dynamic web report allowing auditors to filter controls by regulatory domain.

## Core Principle: "No Log = No Action"

The architecture is enforced by a simple, unbreakable rule: **No economic action may occur without a pre-existing, cryptographically anchored Decision Log.**
