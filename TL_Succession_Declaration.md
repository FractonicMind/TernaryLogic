## **Voluntary Succession Declaration for Ternary Logic**

### **Preamble**

I, Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243), creator of the Ternary Logic framework, affirm this Succession Declaration as the constitutional mechanism guaranteeing the continuity, integrity, and independence of TL beyond the life or participation of its founder. This document binds all governance bodies, institutions, and successors to the Eight Pillars and prevents any dilution, corruption, capture, or redirection of the protocol.

Ternary Logic is a constitutional economic system, not a platform, not a product, and not a legal entity. It exists as a protocol defined entirely by evidence, immutable record, triadic decision structure, and public anchoring.

The Eight Pillars, listed in their causal order, define TL’s identity:

1. Epistemic Hold
2. Immutable Ledger
3. The Goukassian Principle
4. Decision Logs
5. Economic Rights and Transparency Mandate
6. Sustainable Capital Allocation Mandate
7. Hybrid Shield
8. Anchors

Their order is essential. Changing the order breaks the system’s constitutional identity. None of these may be removed, weakened, reordered, or replaced under any circumstances.

---

# **Article I: Constitutional Immutability**

The Eight Pillars constitute the constitutional core of TL. They are above governance, above councils, above institutions, and above individual interpretation. They cannot be amended, suspended, overridden, or subjected to a vote.

Only additive clarifications that strengthen protection, increase integrity, or improve evidentiary certainty are allowed. No form of subtraction or weakening is valid.

Any attempt to modify the core structure triggers immediate Epistemic Hold, public anchoring of the violation, and governance intervention.

---

# **Article II: Governance Triad and Defined Authority**

The governance structure of TL consists of three bodies:

### **1. Technical Council**

Nine members, independent, global.
Mandate: correctness, security, infrastructure, cryptography, protocol evolution that strengthens but never alters Pillars.
Quorum: seven of nine.

### **2. Stewardship Custodians**

Eleven members, multinational, independent of governments and corporations.
Mandate: anti-capture oversight, interpretation of constitutional boundaries, protection of economic rights and transparency mandates.
Quorum: nine of eleven.

### **3. Smart Contract Treasury**

Non-human autonomous financial steward.
Mandate: enforce the No Switch Off rule, fund anchoring, continuity, and operational security.
Subordinate to constitution, not to human councils.

None of these bodies may alter foundational identity. Their authority exists only within the bounds set by the Eight Pillars.

---

# **Article III: Succession Order**

Upon confirmed permanent cessation of the founder’s participation, succession follows this immutable order:

1. The Technical Council assumes all technical stewardship.
2. The Stewardship Custodians assume all constitutional and ethical oversight.
3. The Smart Contract Treasury remains the final guard of operational continuity.

This order cannot be reversed, reordered, bypassed, or amended.

---

# **Article IV: Limits of Authority**

Governance may:

* maintain TL
* extend TL
* optimize TL
* improve performance
* update cryptographic standards
* expand Anchors
* maintain repositories
* ensure continuity

Governance may not:

* modify, dilute, or reinterpret the Eight Pillars
* suspend or disable the Ledger
* change the triadic decision mechanism
* alter causal order of the Pillars
* weaken Anchoring requirements
* override the No Switch Off rule
* nationalize, privatize, or capture TL

Any violation becomes part of the permanent economic record through Anchors.

---

# **Article V: Anti-Capture and Economic Neutrality**

Ternary Logic cannot be:

* owned
* bought
* sold
* nationalized
* privatized
* enclosed
* forked for authoritative claims
* subordinated to any government or corporation

No state, institution, private entity, or consortium may claim custodial ownership over TL or any of its constitutional components.

All attempts at capture shall be met with automatic Epistemic Hold, public anchoring, and governance escalation.

---

# **Article VI: Dead Man’s Switch Protocol**

The Dead Man’s Switch operates in two layers.

### **Layer 1: Founder Non-Response**

If the founder is non-responsive for the defined period, authority transfers to Technical Council and Stewardship Custodians.

### **Layer 2: Governance Failure**

If both councils fail quorum, the protocol enters Locked Operational Mode:

* Anchoring continues
* Immutable Ledger continues
* Evidence continues
* No modifications allowed
* Treasury funds only essential operations

TL remains alive but frozen until legitimate governance is restored.

---

# **Article VII: Custody of Assets and Repositories**

Upon succession:

* All TL repositories transfer to Technical Council custodianship.
* All multi-signature access keys transfer to the designated governance structure.
* Stewardship Custodians hold all notarized documents, constitutional records, and anchored proofs.
* No successor may delete, privatize, or unanchor any versioned history across repositories.

All past proofs remain valid forever.

---

# **Article VIII: Continuity Obligations**

Successors must ensure:

* Anchors remain active across multiple public chains
* Immutable Ledger remains intact and compatible
* Decision Logs remain unbroken
* No Switch Off rule is enforced
* Epistemic Hold functions continuously
* Protocol availability is guaranteed globally
* All API compatibility for evidence retrieval remains untouched

Continuity is a constitutional duty, not a choice.

---

# **Article IX: Affirmation of Perpetuity**

Ternary Logic does not depend on one person, one institution, or one era. Its design ensures it survives:

* political transitions
* market collapses
* technological change
* corporate pressure
* state interference

Its survival is tied to cryptography, consensus, and the permanence of anchored proof.

This declaration guarantees that TL cannot be extinguished.
