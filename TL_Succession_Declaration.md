# Succession Declaration

## Voluntary Succession Declaration for Ternary Moral Logic

### Formal Declaration by Lev Goukassian

**I, Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243), creator of the Ternary Logic (TL) framework, hereby declare my voluntary succession of stewardship responsibilities for the TL project, effective immediately upon signing and witnessing of this declaration.**

**Ternary Logic is a constitutional economic protocol built on the triadic model. Its identity is defined by the Eight Pillars:**

1.  Epistemic Hold   
2.  Immutable Ledger   
3.  The Goukassian Principle   
4.  Decision Logs   
5.  Economic Rights and Transparency   
6.  Sustainable Capital Allocation   
7.  The Hybrid Shield   
8.  Anchors   

This document ensures these Pillars remain the unalterable foundation of the protocol, independent of any individual.

## Article I: Constitutional Immutability

The Eight Pillars are the foundational axioms of the Ternary Logic protocol. They are immutable, non-negotiable, and permanently outside the scope of any governance function, vote, or emergency procedure.

No body or council, including the Technical Council or the Stewardship Custodians, may vote to alter, remove, weaken, or reorder the Eight Pillars. Governance is explicitly forbidden from modifying the foundational mechanics of the protocol, its triadic logic, or its core causal sequence.

Only additive clarifications that strengthen the protections of the Pillars and their associated mandates are constitutionally permissible.

## Article II: Order of Succession

Upon a permanent cessation of participation by the founder, Lev Goukassian, as verified and triggered by the autonomous mechanism defined in the Succession Charter, all stewardship authorities shall pass in the following strict and non-alterable order:

1.  **The Technical Council:** Receives all authorities related to the maintenance, optimization, and technical stewardship of the protocol's infrastructure, code, and performance.
2.  **The Stewardship Custodians:** Receive all authorities related to ethical oversight, mandate enforcement, constitutional interpretation, and anti-capture review.
3.  **The Smart Contract Treasury:** Remains the autonomous and unalterable guard of the protocol's financial resources. It executes its programmatic mandate to fund continuity but remains subordinate to the constitutional rules encoded within it, not the discretionary will of the succeeding governance bodies.

## Article III: Limits of Governance Authority

The authority granted to the Technical Council and Stewardship Custodians upon succession is strictly enumerated and constitutionally limited.

**Permitted Actions:** The governance bodies may maintain TL. They may extend TL. They may optimize TL. This includes, but is not limited to, selecting and rotating Anchors, approving cryptographic standards, tuning performance, and executing the mandates of the Memorial Fund, provided such actions do not conflict with the Eight Pillars.

**Prohibited Actions:** The governance bodies cannot modify the foundational mechanics of the protocol. They cannot disable TL. They cannot reinterpret, suspend, or revoke any of the Eight Pillars or the core `No Switch Off` mandate.

## Article IV: The Dead Man's Switch Protocol

This Declaration institutes an autonomous Dead Man's Switch, encoded at the smart contract layer, to ensure continuity and enforce the `No Switch Off` mandate.

If the founder is non-responsive for the contractually defined period, the protocol autonomously transfers custodial authority to the governance bodies as defined in Article II.

Furthermore, should the Technical Council and Stewardship Custodians *both* fail to meet their constitutional quorum or perform their duties for a subsequent defined period, the Dead Man's Switch protocol shall activate. In this failure state, the Smart Contract Treasury will enter a "locked operational" mode. It will continue to autonomously fund the bare-minimum services required for protocol survival, such as Anchor fees and `Immutable Ledger` maintenance, but will lock all other discretionary functions until a valid governance quorum is restored.

The protocol itself remains operational but immutable, awaiting the reconstitution of its human stewards.

## Article V: Custody of Foundational Assets

Upon succession, custodial authority over all protocol assets shall be transferred from the founder to the governance bodies in a defined, multi-signature framework.

1.  **Repositories and Code:** Primary custody of all canonical code repositories is transferred to the Technical Council.
2.  **Keys and Access:** Administrative keys for protocol maintenance are transferred to a multi-signature wallet controlled by the Technical Council. Custodial keys for ethical review functions and constitutional oversight are transferred to the Stewardship Custodians.
3.  **Notarized Documents and Proofs:** The Stewardship Custodians shall assume perpetual custody of all canonical legal documents, constitutional declarations (including this one), and the master archive of all notarized, blockchain-anchored proofs. These artifacts serve as the permanent, unalterable evidence of the protocol's history and state.

## Article VI: Obligations of Continuity

The succeeding governance bodies inherit a solemn and non-negotiable obligation to ensure the perpetual continuity of the Ternary Logic protocol.

This obligation includes:

1.  **Maintenance of Anchors:** Ensuring that the protocol's state, as recorded in the `Immutable Ledger` and `Decision Logs`, is continuously and verifiably anchored across a diverse and secure set of external ledgers.
2.  **Integrity of the Immutable Ledger:** Upholding the standards of the `Immutable Ledger` and ensuring that all new data blocks are fully compatible with all prior proofs. No action may be taken that would invalidate or orphan historical data.
3.  **Upholding the `No Switch Off` Mandate:** Allocating all necessary resources from the Smart Contract Treasury to guarantee the protocol remains permanently operational, secure, and available to all users.

## Article VII: Affirmation of Continuity

Ternary Logic is a constitutional protocol, not a personal instrument. It was designed to be independent of any single person, founder, or institution. This Declaration ensures that the protocol's integrity, defined by the Eight Pillars, persists in perpetuity.

Continuity is not a signature, it is the intention that refuses to fade.
