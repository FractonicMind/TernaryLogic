# Contributing to the Ternary Logic Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Ternary Logic Framework! This project represents a fundamental advancement in economic decision-making under uncertainty, and we welcome contributions from researchers, developers, and practitioners worldwide.

##  Vision & Mission

The Ternary Logic Framework embodies the principle that **"The world is not binary. And the future will not be either."** Our mission is to provide tools that handle economic uncertainty intelligently, moving beyond forced binary choices to embrace the wisdom of the "Epistemic Hold."

### Local Development
```bash
# Fork https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryLogic first, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TernaryLogic.git
cd TernaryLogic

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install as ternary-logic package
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies if needed
pip install pytest black flake8

# Run tests
pytest

# Run linting
flake8 src/
black src/
```
