*"I taught systems to feel the weight of uncertainty, and the wisdom of deliberate pause. I hesitated — and made the future more thoughtful."* — Lev Goukassian

This framework represents Lev Goukassian's final contribution to humanity—a vision of economic systems that serve as **intelligent partners** in decision-making under uncertainty. Created during his battle with terminal cancer, TL embodies his belief that the future of economics lies not in faster decisions, but in wiser ones.

---

## What is Ternary Logic?

Ternary Logic (TL) revolutionizes economic decision-making by introducing a third computational state between "proceed" and "stop": the **Epistemic Hold**. This framework enables economic systems to recognize when they need more information or human judgment, creating space for wisdom in an increasingly automated financial world.

### The Three States of Economic Reasoning

- __+1 (Proceed)__ Execute with confidence when signals align and uncertainty is manageable
-  __0 (Epistemic Hold)__ Pause for deliberation when market complexity exceeds confidence thresholds
- __-1 (Halt)__ Stop or reject when significant risks or contradictory signals are detected

**"Epistemic Hold is the gatekeeper; nothing passes to Yes or No until it collects the toll of uncertainty."**

##  Mandatory - Read First

**CRITICAL**: Before implementing TL, you **MUST** understand the fundamental principles. Misuse in economic systems can cause significant financial losses, missed opportunities, or systematic risks.

###  [**Read the Mandatory Guidelines →**](docs/MANDATORY.md)

###  [**Read the Mandatory Researh Report →**](docs/Mandatory_Research_Report.md)

**The Epistemic Hold (0) is not indecision** - it is a deliberate, active choice to gather more information when uncertainty exceeds acceptable thresholds. This distinction is fundamental to the framework's success.

## Why TL Matters

### The Problem with Binary Economic Decisions

Current economic systems force complex financial decisions into binary choices:
-  Buy vs.  Sell
- Fast execution prioritized over thoughtful analysis
- Risk conflicts hidden rather than surfaced
- No mechanism for systematic uncertainty acknowledgment

## Quick Start

 **[Quick Start Guide →](docs/QUICK_START.md)** - Implement TL in 60 minutes

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryLogic.git
cd TernaryLogic

# Install the framework
pip install -e .
```

### Your First Economic Evaluation

```python
from ternary_logic import TLEvaluator, TLState

# Create evaluator
evaluator = TLEvaluator()

# Evaluate an economic scenario
result = evaluator.evaluate(
    "Should I execute this large block trade?",
    context={
        "market_volatility": "elevated",
        "liquidity_conditions": "moderate",
        "news_sentiment": "mixed",
        "technical_signals": "bullish",
        "position_size": "large"
    }
)

# Interpret the result
print(f"TL Decision: {result.state.name}")
print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")

if result.state == TLState.EPISTEMIC_HOLD:
    print("\nQuestions for analysis:")
    for question in result.clarifying_questions:
        print(f"  • {question}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TL Decision: EPISTEMIC_HOLD
Reasoning: Elevated volatility combined with large position size creates 
significant execution risk. Mixed sentiment suggests incomplete market 
information, warranting additional analysis before execution.

Questions for analysis:
  • What is the current bid-ask spread and market depth?
  • How does this position affect overall portfolio risk?
  • Are there alternative execution strategies to minimize market impact?
```

## Final Words

> *"The world is not binary. And the future will not be either."*

Ternary Logic represents more than a technical framework—it embodies a philosophy of **human-system partnership** in economic reasoning. By introducing the Epistemic Hold, we create space for wisdom in an increasingly automated financial world.

Every time you use TL, you honor Lev Goukassian's memory and advance his vision of economic systems that are **intelligent partners, not thoughtless automatons**.

**The future of economics is not just efficient—it's wise.**
