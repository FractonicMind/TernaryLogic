*"I taught systems to feel the weight of uncertainty, and the wisdom of deliberate pause. I hesitated — and made the future more thoughtful."* — Lev Goukassian

This framework represents Lev Goukassian's final contribution to humanity—a vision of economic systems that serve as **intelligent partners** in decision-making under uncertainty. Created during his battle with terminal cancer, TL embodies his belief that the future of economics lies not in faster decisions, but in wiser ones.

---

## What is Ternary Logic?

Ternary Logic (TL) revolutionizes economic decision-making by introducing a third computational state between "proceed" and "stop": the **Epistemic Hold**. This framework enables economic systems to recognize when they need more information or human judgment, creating space for wisdom in an increasingly automated financial world.

### The Three States of Economic Reasoning

- **+1 (Proceed)**: Execute with confidence when signals align and uncertainty is manageable
- **0 (Epistemic Hold)**: Pause for deliberation when market complexity exceeds confidence thresholds
- **-1 (Halt)**: Stop or reject when significant risks or contradictory signals are detected

**"Epistemic Hold is the gatekeeper; nothing passes to Yes or No until it collects the toll of uncertainty."**

## ⚠️ Mandatory - Read First

**CRITICAL**: Before implementing TL, you **MUST** understand the fundamental principles. Misuse in economic systems can cause significant financial losses, missed opportunities, or systematic risks.

### 📋 [**Read the Mandatory Guidelines →**](docs/MANDATORY.md)

**The Epistemic Hold (0) is not indecision** - it is a deliberate, active choice to gather more information when uncertainty exceeds acceptable thresholds. This distinction is fundamental to the framework's success.

## Quick Start

📚 **[Quick Start Guide →](docs/QUICK_START.md)** - Implement TL in 60 minutes

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryLogic.git
cd TernaryLogic

# Install the framework
pip install -e .
```

### Your First Economic Evaluation

```python
from ternary_logic import TLEvaluator, TLState

# Create evaluator
evaluator = TLEvaluator()

# Evaluate an economic scenario
result = evaluator.evaluate(
    "Should I execute this large block trade?",
    context={
        "market_volatility": "elevated",
        "liquidity_conditions": "moderate",
        "news_sentiment": "mixed",
        "technical_signals": "bullish",
        "position_size": "large"
    }
)

# Interpret the result
print(f"TL Decision: {result.state.name}")
print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")

if result.state == TLState.EPISTEMIC_HOLD:
    print("\nQuestions for analysis:")
    for question in result.clarifying_questions:
        print(f"  • {question}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TL Decision: EPISTEMIC_HOLD
Reasoning: Elevated volatility combined with large position size creates 
significant execution risk. Mixed sentiment suggests incomplete market 
information, warranting additional analysis before execution.

Questions for analysis:
  • What is the current bid-ask spread and market depth?
  • How does this position affect overall portfolio risk?
  • Are there alternative execution strategies to minimize market impact?
```
