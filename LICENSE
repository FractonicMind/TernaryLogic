FRAMEWORK PHILOSOPHY

The Ternary Logic framework embodies Lev Goukassian's vision that
economic systems should serve as intelligent partners with humans, not 
replacements for human economic judgment. The Epistemic Hold represents the 
computational equivalent of economic wisdom—the recognition that complex 
market decisions require deliberation rather than immediate action.

This framework was created as Lev's gift to humanity's economic future, 
developed during his final months as a contribution to more thoughtful, 
resilient economic decision-making worldwide.

"The world is not binary. And the future will not be either."
