# Institutional Access Framework for Ternary Logic (TL)

**Memorial Legacy Protection System**  
**In Memory of Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)**

---

## Purpose and Vision

This document establishes the framework for institutional access to the Ternary Logic (TL) system, ensuring that Lev Goukassian's groundbreaking work reaches legitimate academic, research, and beneficial organizations while maintaining protection against misuse.

> *"The epistemic hold should serve humanity's highest aspirations, not its basest impulses."* — Institutional Access Principle

---

## Access Philosophy

### Core Principle: Beneficial Use Prioritization

The TL framework is designed to enhance human moral and economic reasoning, not replace it. Institutional access is granted based on alignment with this fundamental principle and commitment to using TL for the betterment of humanity.

### Epistemic Hold in Access Decisions

Just as TL introduces the Epistemic Hold for moral and economic complexity, our access decisions incorporate deliberate reflection when evaluating institutional requests that may have complex implications.
