# Misuse Prevention Protocols for Ternary Logic (TL)

**Active Protection Against Harmful Applications**  
**In Memory of Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)**

## License Revocation Protocols

### Revocation Authority

**Community-Based Revocation:**
- Violations may trigger community-led revocation proceedings
- Affected communities have standing to request license termination
- Academic institutions may revoke access privileges collectively
- Technical community can implement code-level blocking mechanisms

### Revocation Triggers

**Automatic Revocation Situations:**
- Use of TL in weapons development or deployment
- Mass surveillance violating epistemic or existential integrity
- Discriminatory systems causing documented harm to protected groups
- Commercial exploitation of memorial elements for profit
- Persistent violation of attribution requirements after warning

**Community Vote Revocation:**
- Ethically ambiguous applications requiring deliberation
- Cross-cultural contexts needing pluralistic input
- Novel use cases not explicitly covered by prohibited categories
- Repeat violations after educational engagement

### Revocation Process

**Emergency Revocation:**
1. **Evidence Collection**
2. **Community Alert**
3. **Revocation Declaration**
4. **Technical Implementation**
5. **Legal Notice**

**Standard Revocation:**
1. **Investigation Phase** (1â€“2 weeks)
2. **Reflective Interval** (1 week)
3. **Formal Hearing** (1 week)
4. **Community Decision** (1 week)
5. **Implementation**

### Revocation Implementation

**Technical Enforcement:**
```python
class LicenseRevocationError(Exception):
    pass

def check_license_status(user_id, org):
    revoked = load_revocation_list()
    if user_id in revoked or org in revoked:
        raise LicenseRevocationError(f"Revoked: {org}")
    return True
```

**Community Enforcement:**
- Public revocation registry
- Academic and industry notifications
- GitHub and platform reporting
- Media awareness campaigns

## Mission Statement

The TL framework enhances human reasoning across moral, epistemic, and existential domains. These protocols ensure TL remains a tool for wisdom, not harm.

> *"A framework built for wisdom must not be perverted into a tool for oppression."*

## Prevention Philosophy
